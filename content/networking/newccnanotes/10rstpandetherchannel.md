STP and MSTP now exist as part of the 802.1Q standard, which defines VLANs and VLAN trunking.

These two commands cause the switch to make a choice of priority value but then store the chosen priority value in thespanning-tree vlan x priority valuecommand.The command with root primary or root secondary  
does not appear in the configurationcurrent root switch and chooses either (a) 24,576 or (b) 4096 less than the current root’s priority (if the current. When configuring root primary, the switch looks at the priority of the  
root’s priority is 24,576 or less) to the configuration instead. When configuring, root secondary always results in that switch using a priority of 28,672, with the assumption that the value will be less than other switches that  
use the default of 32,768, and higher than any switch configured as root primary.

RSTP sends one set of RSTP messages (BPDUs) in the network, no matter the number of VLANs, while RPVST+ sends one set of messages per VLAN.
RSTP and RPVST+ use different destination MAC addresses: RSTP with multicast address 0180.C200.0000 (an address defined in the IEEE standard), and RPVST+ with multicast address 0100.0CCC.CCCD (an address chosen
by Cisco).
When transmitting messages on VLAN trunks, RSTP sends the messages in the native VLAN with no VLAN header/tag. RPVST+ sends each VLAN’s messages inside that VLAN—for instance, BPDUs about VLAN 9 have an
802.1Q header that lists VLAN 9.
RPVST+ adds an extra type(because it does not need to, as RSTP ignores VLANs.)-length value (TLV) to the BPDU that identifies the VLAN ID, while RSTP does not

Port Costs: The interface subcommand cost on that port, either for all VLANs or for a specific VLAN on that port. Changing those costs then changes the spanning-tree [vlan x] cost ylets an engineer set the switch’s STP/RSTP

Configuring Layer 2 Etherchannel  
Configuring a Manual Layer 2 EtherChannel  
simply add the correct channelall with the on keyword, and all with the same number. The on keyword tells the switches to place a -group configuration command to each physical interface, on each switch,  
physical interface into an EtherChannel, and the number identifies the PortChannel interface number that the interface should be a part of.

Configuring Dynamic EtherChannels  
Cisco switches also support two different configuration options that then use a dynamic protocol to negotiate whether a particular link becomes part of an EtherChannel or not. Basically, the configuration  
enables a protocol for a particular channelto send messages to/from the neighboring switch and discover whether their configuration settings pass -group number. At that point, the switch can use the protocol  
all checks. If a given physical link passes, the link is added to the EtherChannel and used; if not, it is placed in a down state, and not used, until the configuration inconsistency can be resolved.  
Most Cisco Catalyst switches support thestandard Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP),Cisco-proprietary Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) and the IEEE  
negotiate so that only links that pass the configuration checks are actually used in an EtherChannel.  
LACP does support more links in a channelcan be active at one time, with the others waiting to be used should any of the other links fail.— 16 —as compared to PAgP’s maximum of 8. With LACP, only 8  
To configure either protocol, a switch uses the channelbut with a keyword that either means “use this protocol and begin negotiations” or “use this protocol and -group configuration commands on each switch,  
wait for the other switch to begin negotiations.”  
desirable and auto keywords enable PAgP  
active and passive keywords enable LACP.  
with PAgP, at least one of the two sides must use desirable, and with LACP, at least one of the two sides must use active.

```
Do not use the on parameter on one end, and either auto or desirable (or for LACP, active or passive) on the neighboring switch. The on option uses neither PAgP nor LACP, so a configuration that uses on, with
PAgP or LACP options on the other end, would prevent the EtherChannel from working.
#show etherchannel 1 port-channel.
```

Physical Interface Configuration and EtherChannels  
the switch compares the new physical port’s configuration to the existing ports in the channel. That new physical interface’s settings must be the same as the existing ports’ settings; otherwise, the switch does  
not add the new link to the list of approved and working interfaces in the channel. That is, the physical interface remains configured as part of the PortChannel, but it is not used as part of the channel,  
The list of items the switch checks includes the following:  
▪▪SpeedDuplex  
▪▪Operational access or trunking state (all must be access, or all must be trunks)If an access port, the access VLAN  
▪▪If a trunk port, the allowed VLAN list (per the switchport trunk allowed command)If a trunk port, the native VLAN  
▪STP interface settings  
switches check the settings on the neighboring switch. To do so, the switches either use PAgP or LACP (if already in use) or use Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) if using manual configuration. When checking  
neighbors, all settings except the STP settings must match.

```

```

when a switch applies the shutdown and no shutdown commands to a PortChannel, it applies those same commands to the physical interfaces, as well; so, just do the shutdown/no shutdown on the PortChannel  
interface.  
EtherChannel Load Distribution  
When using Layer 2 EtherChannels,PortChannel interfaces and not the underlying physical portsa switch’s MAC learning process associates MAC addresses with the. Later, when a switch makes a forwarding  
decision to send a frame out a PortChannel interface, the switch must do more work: tspecific physical port to use to forward the frame. IOS documentation refers to those rules as o decide out which  
EtherChannel load distribution or load balancing.  
Configuration options for EtherChannel Load Distribution  
EtherChannel load distribution makes the choice for each frame based on various numeric values found in the Layer 2, 3, and 4 headers. The process uses one configurable setting as input: the load distribution  
method as defined with theperforms some match against the fields identified by the configured method.port-channel load-balance methodglobal command. The process then

various load distribution algorithms do share some common goals:  
To being sent over different links.cause all messages in a single application flow to use the same link in the channel, rather than Doing so means that the switch will not inadvertently reorder the  
messages sent in that application flow by sending one message over a busy link that has a queue of waiting messages, while immediately sending the next message out an unused link.  
To integrate the load distribution algorithm work into the hardware forwarding ASIC so that load distribution works just as quickly as the work to forward any other frame.  
To use all the active links in the EtherChannel, adjusting to the addition and removal of active links over time.  
Within the constraints of the other goals, balance the traffic across those active links.  
the algorithms first intend to avoid message reordering, make use of the switch forwarding ASICs, and use all the active links. However, the algorithm does not attempt to send the exact same number of bits over  
each link over time.other goals. The algorithm does try to balance the traffic, but always within the constraints of the

```
All three tests list the same outgoing physical interface because (1) the method uses only the source MAC address, and
all three tests use the same MAC addresses. All three tests use a different destination MAC address, with different low-order bits, but that had no impact on the choice because the method—src-mac—
does not consider the destination MAC address.
