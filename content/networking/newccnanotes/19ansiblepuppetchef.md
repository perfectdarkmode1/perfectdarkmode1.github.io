Configuration Drift

The on-device manual configuration process does not track change history: which lines changed, what changed on each line, what old configuration was removed, who changed the configuration, when each change was made.
External systems used by good systems management processes, like trouble ticketing and change management software, may record details. However, those sit outside the configuration and
require analysis to figure out what changed. They also rely on humans to follow the operational processes consistently and correctly; otherwise, an engineer cannot find the entire history of
changes to a configuration.
Referring to historical data in change management systems works poorly if a device has gone through multiple configuration changes over a period of time.
Centralized Configuration Files and Version Control
```


```
configuration management tools use version control software to track the changes to centralized configuration files, noting who changes a file, what lines and specific characters changed, when
the change occurred, and so on.
also allow you to compare the differences between versions of the files over time
```

Configuration Monitoring and Enforcement  
With this new modelin the centralized repository. The configuration management tool can then be directed to copy or , engineers should make changes by editing the associated configuration files  
apply the configuration to the device  
the central config file and the device’s running-config (and startup-config) should be identical.

```
eventually someone will change the devices directly
eventually, some configuration drift can occur.
Configuration management toolsconfiguration differs from the intended ideal configuration, and then either reconfigure the can monitor device configurations to discover when the device

changes the device configuration.
The automated configuration management software asks for a copy of the device’s runningconfig file, as shown in steps 1 and 2. At step 3, the config management software compares the -
ideal config file with the just-arrived running-config file to check whether they have any
differences (configuration drift). Per the configuration of the tool, it either fixes the configuration or notifies the staff about the configuration drift.
```

Configuration Provisioning  
how to provision or deploy changes to the configuration once made by changing files in the  
configuration management system.  
some of the majorfeatures included in all of the configuration management tools  
The core function toimplement configuration changes in one device after someone has  
edited the device’s centralized configuration file  
The ability to attribute (such as those of a particular role), or just one device, based on attributes and choose which subset of devices to configure: all devices, types with a given

attribute (such as those of a particular role), or just one device, based on attributes and logic  
The ability to determine if each change was accepted or rejected, and to use logic to react  
differently in each case depending on the result  
For each change, the ability to revert to the original configuration if even one configuration  
command is rejected on a device  
Thewhether the change will work or not when attemptedability to validate the change now (without actually making the change) to determine  
The ability to configuration management tool’s intended configuration does match the device’s check the configuration after the process completes to confirm that the  
configuration  
The ability tonot use logic to choose whether to save the running-config to startup-config or  
The ability to similar roles can use the same template but with different valuesrepresent configuration files as templates and variables so that devices with  
The ability to store the logic steps in a file, scheduled to execute, so that the changes can be  
implemented by the automation tool without the engineer being present  
Configuration Templates and Variables

```
Configuration management tools can separate the components of a configuration into the parts
in common to all devices in that role (the variables) (the template)versus the parts unique to any one device
```

```
Ansible using the Jinja2 language for templates
```

To supply the values for a device,Ansible calls for defining variable files using YAML  
The file shows the Example 19-1, but now defined as variables.syntax for defining the variables shown in the complete configuration in

the engineer would create and edit one template filethat looks like Example 19- 2

the engineer would create and edit one template filethat looks like Example 19- 2  
then create and edit one variable file like Example 19would process the files to create complete configuration files like the text shown in Example 19-3 for each branch office router. Ansible -1.  
using templates has some big advantages.  
Templates helping to avoid snowflakes (uniquely configured devices).increase the focus on having a standard configuration for each device role,  
New devices with an existing role can be deployed easily by simply copying an existing per-  
device variable file and changing the values.  
Templatesallow for easier troubleshooting because troubleshooting issues with one  
standard template should find and fix issues with all devices that use the same template.  
Tracking the file versions for the template versus the variables files allows for easier troubleshooting as well. Issues with a device can be investigated to find changes in the  
device’s settings separately from the standard configuration template.  
Files That Control Configuration Automation  
Configuration management tools provide methods that tell the tool what changes to make, to  
which devices, and when  
the files you could see in any of the configuration management tools.

Ansible, Puppet, and Chef Basics  
some of the tools do not run in a Windows OS

```
you need to install Ansible on some computer: Mac, Linux, or a Linux VM
free open-source version or use the paid Ansible Tower serverversion
Once it is installed, you create several text files, such as the following:
```

```
Ansible
```

```
Playbooks:These files provide actions and logic about what Ansible should do.
Inventory:These files provide device hostnames along with information about each
device, like device roles, so Ansible can perform functions for subsets of the inventory
Templates: Using Jinja2 language, the templates represent a device’s configuration
but with variables(see Example 19-2).
Variablestemplates: Using YAML, a file can list variables that Ansible will substitute into (see Example 19-3).
uses an agentlessarchitecture
Ansible does not rely on any code (agent) running on the network device
Ansiblemake changes and extract information.relies on features typical in network devices, namely SSH and/or NETCONF, to
using apush model(per Figure 19-8) rather than a pull model (like Puppet and Chef)
```

Ansible can do both configuration provisioning (configuring devices after changes are made in the files) and configuration monitoring (checking to find out whether the device config  
matches the ideal configuration on the control node).  
To do configuration monitoring, Ansible uses logic modules that detect and list configuration differences, after which the playbook defines what action to take (reconfigure  
or notify).  
Puppet  
installing Puppet on aLinuxhost  
install it on aLinux server called a Puppet master  
free open-source version with paid versions available  
Puppet also uses several important text files with different components

```
Manifest: This is a human-readable text file on the Puppet master, using a language
defined by Puppet, used to define the desired configuration state of a device.
Resource, Class, Modulelargest component (module) being composed of smaller classes, which are in turn : These terms refer to components of the manifest, with the
composed of resources.
Templates: Using a Puppet domain-specific language, these files allow Puppet to
generate manifests (and modules, classes, and resources) by substituting variables into the template.
```

Ansible’s playbooks use an imperative language, whereas Puppet uses a declarative language

with Ansible, the playbook will list tasks and choices based on those results, like  
“Configure all branch routers in these locations, and if errors occur for any device, do these extra tasks for that device.” Puppet manifests instead declare the end state that  
a device should have: “This branch router should have the configuration in this file by the end of the process.” The manifest, built by the engineer, defines the end state,  
and Puppet has the job to cause the device to have that configuration, without being  
told the specific set of steps to take.  
uses an agent-based architecture for network device support.  
Some network devices enable Puppet support via an on-device agent  
not every Cisco OS supports Puppet agents, so Puppet solves that problem usinga proxy  
agent running on some external hostuses SSH to communicate with the network device(calledagentless operation). The external agent then

uses a pull model to make that configuration appear in the device  
Step 1. The engineer creates and edits all the files on the Puppet server.  
Step 2. The engineereach device. configures and enables the on-device agent or a proxy agent for  
Step 3. The agent pulls manifest details from the server, which tells the agent what its  
configuration should be.

```
configuration should be.
Step 4. performs additional pulls to get all required detail, with the agent updating the device If the agent device’s configuration should be updated, the Puppet agent
configuration.
```

Chef  
Chef Automatebeing the product that most people refer to simply as Chef  
you probablyrun Chef as a server (called server-client mode  
Chef files that are stored on the Chef server  
you can also run Chef in standalone mode(calledChef Zero), which is helpful when you’re  
just getting started and learning in the lab.  
you create several text files with different components,  
Resource:The configuration objects whose state is managed by Chef; for instance, a  
set of configuration commands for a network devicea recipe in a cookbook —analogous to the ingredients in  
Recipe:TheChef logic applied to resources to determine when, how, and whether to  
act against the resources—analogous to a recipe in a cookbook  
Cookbooks: A set of recipes about the same kinds of work, grouped together for  
easier management and sharing  
Runlist: Anordered list of recipes that should be run against a given device  
each managed device (called a Chef node or Chef client) runs an agent. configuration monitoring in that the client pulls recipes and resources from the Chef server The agent performs  
and then adjusts its configuration to stay in sync with the details in those recipes and runlists  
Chef requires on-device Chef client code, and many Cisco devices do not support a Chef

Chef requires onclient, so you will likely see more use of Ansible and Puppet for Cisco device configuration -device Chef client code, and many Cisco devices do not support a Chef  
management.  
Summary of Configuration Management Tools  
Ansible appears to have the most interest, then Puppet, and then Chef. Ansible’s agentless  
architecture and the use of SSH provides support for a wide range of Cisco devices. Puppet’s agentless model also creates wide support for Cisco devices.  
the column for Puppet assumes an on-device agent.
