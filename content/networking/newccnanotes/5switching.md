Overview of Switching Logic

- -Forward or filter frame based on destination MAC AddressExamine source MAC address of each frame received  
    Learning MAC Addresses
- If a frame enters the switch and the source MAC address is not in the MAC address table, the switch creates an entry in the table
- when there is no matching entry in the table, switches forward the frame out all interfaces (except the incoming interface) (Flooding)  
    STP
- either a blocking state or a forwarding state.
- Blocking ○interface cannot forward or receive data frames
- forwarding○interface can send and receive data frames.  
    LAN Switching Summary  
    Forward Frames based on destination MAC address
- If the destination MAC address is a broadcast, multicast, or unknown destination unicast (a unicast not listed in the MAC table), the switch floods the frame.
- If the destination MAC address is a known unicast address (a unicast address found in the MAC table):
- the switch forwards the frame out the outgoing interface.If the outgoing interface is the same as the interface in which the frame was received, the switch
- filters the frame  
    learning MAC address table entries:
- examine the source MAC address on each frame received and note the interface from which the frame was received.
- If it is not already in the table, add the MAC address and interface it was learned on.  
    Verifying and Analyzing Ethernet Switching
- -interfaces are enabled by default10/100 and 10/100/1000 interfaces use autonegotiation by default.  
    Demonstrating MAC Learning  
    **#show mac address** - View mac address table **- table  
    #show mac address** - Show only dynamically learned MAC addresses **- table dynamic  
    #show interfaces status** - status of all interfaces (connected or disconnected)  
    **#show interfaces f0/1 status** - interface status of f0/  
    **#show interfaces f0/1** - Displays detailed set of messages about the interface  
    **#show interfaces f0/1 counters** - Lists the number of unicast, multicast, and broadcast frames (inbound and outbound), and total byte count for those frames  
    **#show mac address** - Shows MAC entry for a single MAC address **- table dynamic address 0200.1111.  
    #show mac address** - Shows MAC entries for a single interface **- table dynamic interface fastEthernet 0/**

**#show mac address** - Shows mac entries for vlan 1 **- table dynamic vlan 1**  
Managing theMAC Address Table (Aging, Clearing)

- -agetable filling
- using a command

```
The switch will remove (time out) the entries due to:
```

```
aging out MAC table entries,-default of 300 seconds
if an entry already exists-inactivity timer goes back to 0 for that entry
```

- globallyper-VLAN using the **mac address-table aging-time** _time-in-seconds_ **[vlan** _vlan-number_ **]** global
- configuration command.

```
aging time -can be configured to a different time
```

```
#show mac address - Shows age time settings for mac entries - table aging-time
#show mac address - Shows how many mac addresses in the table and how much address space is available - table count
if the table fills.-Oldest entries are removed
content--a physical memory that has great table lookup capabilities.Used for MAC Address tables-addressable memory (CAM),
#(en)clear mac address - remove dynamic entries from the mac address table - table dynamic
#(en)clear mac address-table dynamic vlan 1
#(en)clear mac address-table dynamic interface fa0/1
#(en)clear mac address-table dynamic address 3d44.2aab.12c3
