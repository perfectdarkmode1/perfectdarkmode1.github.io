    Twisting of the wires helps reduce EMI.
- EMI between wire pairs

Crosstalk

Gigabit Ethernet interface Converter (GBIC)

- The original form factor for a removeable transceiver for Gigabit interfaces; larger than SFPs  
    Small Form Pluggable (SFP)
- The replacement for GBICs, used on gigabit interfaces, with a smaller size, taking less space on the side of the networking card or switch.

Small Form Pluggable Plus (SFP+)

- Same size as the SFP, but used on 10-Gbps interfaces  
    UTP Cabling Pinouts for 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T
- 2 wire pairs,
- one pair for each direction

- pairs 1/2, 3/6, 4/5, 7/
- Crossover cable crosses the pairs at pins 1/2 and 3/6, it also crosses pairs 4/5 with 7/

Fiber Cabling Transmission Concepts  
Physical cable

- Core >
- - Cladding > Buffer >
- - Strengthener >Outer Jacket
- Shines light into the core

```
Optical Transmitter
```

- - multiple angles (modes) of light waves Less expensive
- 10 gigabit over ethernet allows for distance up to 400m

```
Multimode fiber
```

- Smaller diameter (around 1/5 of multimode) core
- - lasersingle angle-based transmitter  
        More expensive SFP/ SFP+ hardware  
        Distances up to tens of kilometers

```
Single mode fiber
```

```
Transmit port on one end of the fiber connects to the receive port on the other end (Tx and Rx)

Identifying Network Layer Protocols with the Ethernet Type Field  
The type field identifies which type of layer 3 packet exists within the ethernet frame (IPv6 or  
IPv4)Ethertype is the term used for the type field in an ethernet frame

Error Detection with FCS

- Error detection does not mean error recoveryEthernet decide whether the frame should be discarded and does not attempt to recover the lost  
    frame.

frame.  
Sending Ethernet frames with switches and hubs

- - Switches allow the use of Full Duplex LogicHubs use half-duplex logic

Sending in Modern Ethernet LANs Using Full Duplex

- - must wait to send if it is currently receiving a framecannot send and receive at the same time

```
Half duplex
```

- - Does not have to wait before sending, send and receive at the same time.

```
Full Duplex
```

Hubs

- Uses physical link standards instead of data link standards and are considered layer 1 devices  
    Carrier Sense multiple access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)  
    1.2. Listen until line is not busySend frame

```
ii.i. Send jamming signal telling all nodes a collision has occurredeach node waits a random time then tries to send again
iii. Back to step one
```

3. Listen for a collision while sending if a collision occurs:

- - All links between PCs and switches use full duplexA link connected to a hub should be half duplex

```
○ refers to hubs that use CSMA/CD and share bandwidth
```

- Ethernet Shared media

```
○ network built with switches where links work independently of others
○ A frame can be sent on every Point-to-point link in an ethernet at the same time.
