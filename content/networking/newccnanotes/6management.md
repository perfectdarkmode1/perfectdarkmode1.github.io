4.8 Configure network devices for remote access using SSH5.0 Security Fundamentals  
5.3 Configure device access control using local passwords  
data plane- work a switch does to forward frames generated by the devices connected to the switch  
control plane - configuration and processes that control and change the choices made by the switch’s data plane  
management plane- deals with managing the device itself, rather than controlling what the device is doing

SSH  
**crypto key generate rsa modulus** - (Use at least a 768 - bit key to support SSH version 2.) _modulus-value_  
**show ip ssh** - lists status information about the SSH server  
**show ssh** - lists information about each SSH client currently connected into the switch  
Switch DHCP  
**ip address dhcp  
Show dhcp lease  
show interfaces vlan 1  
show ip default-gateway  
show history** - lists the commands currently held in the history buffer.  
**terminal history size** - - allows a single user to set the size of their history bufferjust for this one login session _x_  
history size x-- console or vty line configuration mode sets the default number of commands saved in the history buffer for the users of the console or vty lines

Logging and domain lookup  
**no logging console  
logging console**

- - line subcommand enables you to set the length of that inactivity timer.
- In the lab (but not in production), you might want to use the special value of“never time out.” 0 minutes and 0 seconds meaning

**exec-timeout minutes seconds**

```
