routers support the show ip route command, while Cisco Layer 2 switches do not.

Layer 2 switches use the show interfaces status command to list one line of output per interface (and routers do not)

show protocols command. This command confirms the state of each of the three R1 interfaces in Figure 15-6 and the IP address and mask configured on those same interfaces.
