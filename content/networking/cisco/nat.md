NAT router simply configures a one-to-one mapping between the private address and the registered address that is used on its behalf.

Supporting a second IP host with static NAT requires a second static one-to-one mapping using a second IP address in the public address range.

the router statically maps 10.1.1.2 to 200.1.1.2. Because the enterprise has a single registered Class C network, it can support at most 254 private IP addresses with NAT, with the usual two reserved numbers (the network number and network broadcast address).

not change, so there is no need for a contrasting 
term. 
Alternative: Think of it as outside public, because 
the address is typically a public IPv4 address. 
This term is not used with source NAT. With desti- 
nation NAT, the address would represent a host that 
resides outside the enterprise, but the address used 
to represent that host as packets pass through the 
local enterprise. ">

### Dynamic NAT

Dynamic NAT sets up a pool of possible inside global addresses and defines matching criteria to determine which inside local IP addresses should be translated with NAT.

Figure 10-5 Dynamic NAT ">

Host 10.1.1.1 sends its first packet to the server at 170.1.1.1.

As the packet enters the NAT router, the router applies some matching logic to decide whether the packet should have NAT applied. Because the logic has been configured to match source IP addresses that begin with 10.1.1, the router adds an entry in the NAT table for 10.1.1.1 as an inside local address.

The NAT router needs to allocate an IP address from the pool of valid inside global addresses. It picks the first one available (200.1.1.1, in this case) and adds it to the NAT table to complete the entry.

The NAT router translates the source IP address and forwards the packet.

The dynamic entry stays in the table as long as traffic flows occasionally. You can configure a timeout value that defines how long the router should wait, having not translated any packets with that address, before removing the dynamic entry. You can also manually clear the dynamic entries from the table using the clear ip nat translation \* command.

NAT can be configured with more IP addresses in the inside local address list than in the inside global address pool.

If a new packet arrives from yet another inside host, and it needs a NAT entry, but all the pooled IP addresses are in use, the router simply discards the packet. The user must try again until a NAT entry times out, at which point the NAT function works for the next host that sends a packet. Essentially, the inside global pool of addresses needs to be as large as the maximum number of concurrent hosts that need to use the Internet at the same time—unless you use PAT, as is explained in the next section.

Dynamic NAT Table, With Overloading 
Figure 10-8 NAT Overload (PAT) ">

The NAT router keeps a NAT table entry for every unique combination of inside local IP address and port, with translation to the inside global address and a unique port number associated with the inside global address.

NAT overload can use more than 65,000 port numbers

PAT is by far the most popular option

## NAT Configuration and Troubleshooting

### Static NAT Configuration

Each static mapping between a local (private) address and a global (public) address must be configured.

Those same interface subcommands tell NAT whether the interface is inside or outside.

Step 1. Use the ip nat inside command in interface configuration mode to configure interfaces to be in the inside part of the NAT design.

Step 2. Use the ip nat outside command in interface configuration mode to configure interfaces to be in the outside part of the NAT design.

Step 3. Use the ip nat inside source static inside-local inside-global command in global configuration mode to configure the static mappings.

static mappings are created using the ip nat inside source static command.

Source keyword means that NAT translates the source IP address of packets coming into its inside interfaces. The static keyword means that the parameters define a static entry, which should never be removed from the NAT table because of timeout. Because the design calls for two hosts—10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2—to have Internet access, two ip nat inside commands are needed.

show ip nat translations command lists the two static NAT entries created in the configuration. The show ip nat statistics command lists statistics, listing things such as the number of currently active translation table entries. The statistics also include the number of hits, which increments for every packet for which NAT must translate addresses.

### Dynamic NAT Configuration

Dynamic NAT still requires that each interface be identified as either an inside or outside interface

Dynamic NAT uses an access control list (ACL) to identify which inside local (private) IP addresses need to have their addresses translated, and it defines a pool of registered public IP addresses to allocate.

Step 1. Use the ip nat inside command in interface configuration mode to configure interfaces to be in the inside part of the NAT design (just like with static NAT).

Step 2. Use the ip nat outside command in interface configuration mode to configure interfaces to be in the outside part of the NAT design (just like with static NAT).

Step 3. Configure an ACL that matches the packets entering inside interfaces for which NAT should be performed.

Step 4. Use the ip nat pool name first-address last-address netmask subnet-mask command in global configuration mode to configure the pool of public registered IP addresses.

Step 5. Use the ip nat inside source list acl-number pool pool-name command in global configuration mode to enable dynamic NAT. Note the command references the ACL (step 3) and pool (step 4) per previous steps.

debug ip nat command. This debug command causes the router to issue a message every time a packet has its address translated for NAT.

### NAT Overload (PAT) Configuration

If PAT uses a pool of inside global addresses, the configuration looks exactly like dynamic NAT, except the ip nat inside source list global command has an overload keyword added to the end. If PAT just needs to use one inside global IP address, the router can use one of its interface IP addresses

configuration when using an interface IP address as the sole inside global IP address:

Step 1. As with dynamic and static NAT, configure the ip nat inside interface sub-command to identify inside interfaces.

Step 2. As with dynamic and static NAT, configure the ip nat outside interface subcommand to identify outside interfaces.

Step 3. As with dynamic NAT, configure an ACL that matches the packets entering inside interfaces.

Step 4. Configure the ip nat inside source list acl-number interface type/number overload global configuration command, referring to the ACL created in step 3 and to the interface whose IP address will be used for translations.

ip nat inside source list 1 interface serial 0/0/0 overload command has several parameters

The list 1 parameter means the same thing as it does for dynamic NAT: inside local IP addresses matching ACL 1 have their addresses translated. The interface serial 0/0/0 parameter means that the only inside global IP address available is the IP address of the NAT router’s interface serial 0/0/0.

The router creates one NAT table entry for each unique combination of inside local IP address and port

NAT Troubleshooting

Reversed inside and outside

Static NAT: Check the ip nat inside source static command to ensure it lists the inside local address first and the inside global IP address second.

Dynamic NAT (ACL): Ensure that the ACL configured to match packets sent by the inside hosts match that host’s packets before any NAT translation has occurred.

Dynamic NAT (pool): For dynamic NAT without PAT, ensure that the pool has enough IP addresses\

A large or growing value in the second misses counter in the show ip nat statistics command output can indicate this problem. Also, compare the configured pool to the list of addresses in the NAT translation table (show ip nat translations). Finally, if the pool is small, the problem may be that the configuration intended to use PAT and is missing the overload keyword

PAT: It is easy to forget to add the overload option

perhaps NAT has been configured correctly, but an ACL exists on one of the interfaces, discarding the packets.

IOS processes ACLs before NAT. For packets exiting an interface, IOS processes any outbound ACL after translating the addresses with NAT.
