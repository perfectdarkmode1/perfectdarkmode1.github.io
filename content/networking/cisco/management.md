```

```
show interfaces vlan 1
```

```
show ip default-gateway
```

## History

```
show history
```

```
history size x

## Logging and Domain Lookup

```

```

```
exec timeout (minutes)
```

data plane

-   work a switch does to forward frames generated by the devices connected to the switch

control plane

-   configuration and processes that control and change the choices made by the switch’s data plane

management plane

-   deals with managing the device itself, rather than controlling what the device is doing

SSH

crypto key generate rsa modulus modulus-value

-   (Use at least a 768-bit key to support SSH version 2.)

show ip ssh

-   lists status information about the SSH server

 show ssh

-   lists information about each SSH client currently connected into the switch

Switch DHCP

 ip address dhcp

Show dhcp lease

show interfaces vlan 1

show ip default-gateway

show history

-   lists the commands currently held in the history buffer.

terminal history size x

-   allows a single user to set the size of their history buffer
-   just for this one login session

history size x

-   console or vty line configuration mode
-   sets the default number of commands saved in the history buffer for the users of the console or vty lines

Logging and domain lookup

no logging console

logging console

exec-timeout minutes seconds

-   line subcommand
-   enables you to set the length of that inactivity timer.
-   In the lab (but not in production), you might want to use the special value of 0 minutes and 0 seconds meaning “never time out.”
