# System Message Logging (Syslog)

Sending Messages in Real Time to Current Users

-   Telnet and SSH users, the device requires a two-step process before the user sees the messages.
    
-   global configuration setting—logging monitor—tells IOS to enable the sending of log messages to all logged users.
    
-   must also issue the terminal monitor EXEC command during the login session, which tells IOS that this terminal session would like to receive log messages.

Storing Log Messages for Later Review

two primary means to keep a copy

-   can store copies of the log messages in RAM by virtue of the logging buffered global configuration command.

any user can come back later and see the old log messages by using the show logging EXEC command.

store log messages centrally to a syslog server.

syslog protocol - a UDP protocol to send messages to a syslog server for storage

To configure a router or switch to send log messages to a syslog server, add the logging host {address | hostname } global command

Log Message Format

*Dec 18 17:10:15.079: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface FastEthernet0/0, changed state to down

A timestamp: *Dec 18 17:10:15.079

The facility on the router that generated the message: %LINEPROTO

The severity level: 5

A mnemonic for the message: UPDOWN

The description of the message: Line protocol on Interface FastEthernet0/0, changed state to down

you can at least toggle on and off the use of the timestamp (which is included by default) and a log message sequence number (which is not enabled by default). Example 9-1 reverses those defaults by turning off timestamps and turning on sequence numbers.

The debug Command and Log Messages

debug EXEC command gives the network engineer a way to ask IOS to monitor for certain internal events, with that monitoring process continuing over time, so that IOS can issue log messages when those events occur

debug remains active until some user issues the no debug command with the same parameters, disabling the debug.

anyone logged in with SSH at the time Example 9-4’s output was gathered would not have seen the output, even with the logging monitor debug command configured on router R1, without first issuing a terminal monitor command.

all enabled debug options use router CPU, which can cause problems for the router. You can monitor CPU use with the show process cpu command

use caution when using debug commands carefully on production devices.

the more CLI users that receive debug messages, the more CPU that is consumed.

## Network Time Protocol (NTP)

Devices send timestamps to each other with NTP messages, continually exchanging messages, with one device changing its clock to match the other, eventually synchronizing the clocks.

How NTP defines the sources of time data (reference clocks) and how good each time source is (stratum).

Setting the Time and Timezone

NTP works best if you set the device clock to a reasonably close time before enabling the NTP client function with the ntp server command

I should set the time to 8:52 p.m., set the correct date and timezone, and even tell the device to adjust for daylight savings time—and then enable NTP

Example 9-7 shows how to set the date, time, timezone, and daylight savings time.

![Example 9-7 Setting the Date/Time with clock set, Plus Timezone/DST 
Click here to view code image 
Rl# configure terminal 
Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z. 
RI (config)# clock timezone EST -5

Rl# show clock 
EDT Wed 
Oct 21 2015](blob:file:///12712855-da00-4f5f-9301-b908790790c9)

You should set the first two commands before setting the time of day with the clock set EXEC command because the two configuration commands impact the time that is set.

chose EDT because it is the acronym for daylight savings time in that same EST time zone. Finally, the recurring keyword tells the router to spring forward an hour and fall back an hour automatically over the years.

clock set EXEC command

uses a time syntax with a 24-hour format, not with a 12-hour format plus a.m./p.m.).

The show clock command (issued seconds later) lists that time, but also notes the time as EDT, rather than UTC time.

Basic NTP Configuration

two ntp configuration commands

ntp master {stratum-level}: NTP server mode—the device acts only as an NTP server, and not as an NTP client. The device gets its time information from the internal clock on the device.

ntp server {address | hostname} : NTP client/server mode—the device acts as both client and server. First, it acts as an NTP client, to synchronize time with a server. Once synchronized, the device can then act as an NTP server, to supply time to other NTP clients.

show ntp status command

lists a status of synchronized, which confirms the NTP client has completed the process of changing its time to match the server’s time. Any router acting as an NTP client will list “unsynchronized” in that first line until the NTP synchronization process completes with at least one server. It also confirms the IP address of the server—this device’s reference clock—with the IP address configured in Example 9-8 (172.16.2.2).

### NTP Reference Clock and Stratum

Devices that act solely as an NTP server get their time from either internal device hardware or from some external clock using mechanisms other than NTP.

NTP servers and clients use a number to show the perceived accuracy of their reference clock data based on stratum level. The lower the stratum level, the more accurate the reference clock is considered to be. An NTP server that uses its internal hardware or external reference clock sets its own stratum level. Then, an NTP client adds 1 to the stratum level it learns from its NTP server, so that the stratum level increases the more hops away from the original clock source.

For instance, back in Figure 9-5, you can see the NTP primary server (R3) with a stratum of 2. R2, which references R3, adds 1 so it has a stratum of 3. R1 uses R2 as its NTP server, so R1 adds 1 to have a stratum of 4. These increasing stratum levels allow devices to refer to several NTP servers and then use time information from the best NTP server, best being the server with the lowest stratum level.

Routers and switches use the default stratum level of 8 for their internal reference clock based on the default setting of 8 for the stratum level in the ntp master [stratum-level] command. The command allows you to set a value from 1 through 15; in Example 9-8, the ntp master 2 command set router R3’s stratum level to 2.

Note

NTP considers 15 to be the highest useful stratum level, so any devices that calculate their stratum as 16 consider the time data unusable and do not trust the time. So, avoid setting higher stratum values on the ntp master command.

### Redundant NTP Configuration

an enterprise could use NTP to reference NTP servers that use an atomic clock as their reference source, like the NTP primary servers in Figure 9-6, which happen to be run by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (see tf.nist.gov).

![Stratum 1

NTP primary server and NTP secondary server.

An NTP primary server acts only as a server, with a reference clock external to the device, and has a stratum level of 1, like the two NTP primary servers shown in Figure 9-6. NTP secondary servers are servers that use client/server mode as described throughout this section, relying on synchronization with some other NTP server.

![Example 9-12 NTP Configuration on RI, R2 per Eigure 9-6

ntp server time-a-b-nist .gov 
ntp server time-a-g.nist.gov](blob:file:///77c1af69-5be5-421e-983f-f15baed94077)

After losing their reference clock, R1 and R2 could no longer be useful NTP servers to the rest of the enterprise.

To overcome this potential issue, the routers can also be configured with the ntp master command, resulting in this logic:

Establish an association with the NTP servers per the ntp server command.

Establish an association with your internal clock using the ntp master stratum command.

Set the stratum level of the internal clock (per the ntp master {stratum-level} command) to a higher (worse) stratum level than the Internet-based NTP servers.

Synchronize with the best (lowest) known time source, which will be one of the Internet NTP servers in this scenario

ntp master 7 command, with a much higher stratum,

### NTP Using a Loopback Interface for Better Availability

what happens when one interface on R4 fails

for any NTP clients that had referred to that specific IP address

There would likely still be a route to reach R4 itself.

The NTP client would not be able to send packets to the configured address because that interface is down.

![R2

The router remains up.

You do not issue a shutdown command on that loopback interface.

## Analyzing Topology Using CDP and LLDP

### Examining Information Learned by CDP

Cisco-proprietary

Layer 2 protocol

does not rely on a working Layer 3 protocol

Devices that support CDP learn information about others by listening for the advertisements sent by other devices.

CDP discovers several useful details from the neighboring Cisco devices:

Device identifier: Typically the host name

Address list: Network and data-link addresses

Port identifier: The interface on the remote router or switch on the other end of the link that sent the CDP advertisement

Capabilities list: Information on what type of device it is (for example, a router or a switch)

Platform: The model and OS level running on the device

Cisco IP Phones use CDP to learn the data and voice VLAN IDs as configured on the access switch.

The show cdp entry name command lists the exact same details shown in the output of the show cdp neighbors detail command, but for only the one neighbor listed in the command.

Cisco recommends that CDP be disabled on any interface that might not have a need for CDP. For switches, any switch port connected to another switch, a router, or to an IP phone should use CDP.

### Configuring and Verifying CDP

IOS typically enables CDP globally and on each interface by default. You can then disable CDP per interface with the no cdp enable interface subcommand

re-enable it with the cdp enable interface subcommand

disable and re-enable CDP globally on the device

no cdp run and cdp run global commands

send time and the hold time. CDP sends messages every 60 seconds by default, with a hold time of 180 seconds. The hold time tells the device how long to wait after no longer hearing from a device before removing those details from the CDP tables. You can override the defaults with the cdp timer seconds and cdp holdtime seconds global commands, respectively.

the LLDP output in the example does differ from CDP in a few important ways:

LLDP uses B as the capability code for switching, referring to bridge, a term for the device type that existed before switches that performed the same basic functions.

LLDP does not identify IGMP as a capability, while CDP does (I).

CDP lists the neighbor’s platform, a code that defines the device type, while LLDP does not.

LLDP lists capabilities with different conventions (see upcoming Example 9-19).

LLDP uses the same messaging concepts as CDP, encapsulating messages directly in data-link headers. Devices do not forward LLDP messages so that LLDP learns only of directly connected neighbors. LLDP does use a different multicast MAC address (0180.C200.000E)

### Configuring and Verifying LLDP

Cisco devices default to disable LLDP

LLDP separates the sending and receiving of LLDP messages as separate functions.

LLDP support processing receives LLDP messages on an interface so that the switch or router learns about the neighboring device while not transmitting LLDP messages to the neighboring device.

the commands include options to toggle on|off the transmission of LLDP messages separately from the processing of received messages.

[no] lldp run: A global configuration command that sets the default mode of LLDP operation for any interface that does not have more specific LLDP subcommands (lldp transmit, lldp receive). The lldp run global command enables LLDP in both directions on those interfaces, while no lldp run disables LLDP.

[no] lldp transmit: An interface sub-command that defines the operation of LLDP on the interface regardless of the global [no] lldp run command. The lldp transmit interface subcommand causes the device to transmit LLDP messages, while no lldp transmit causes it to not transmit LLDP messages.

[no] lldp receive: An interface subcommand that defines the operation of LLDP on the interface regardless of the global [no] lldp run command. The lldp receive interface subcommand causes the device to process received LLDP messages, while no lldp receive causes it to not process received LLDP messages.

like CDP, LLDP uses a send timer and hold timer for the same purposes as CDP. The example shows the default settings of 30 seconds for the send timer and 120 seconds for the hold timer. You can override the defaults with the lldp timer seconds and lldp holdtime seconds global commands
