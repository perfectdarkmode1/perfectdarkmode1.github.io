When your Lab reservation begins, you will receive several emails communicating important information about the status of your Lab.

The first email is sent to you from the Lab provisioning automation engine, and indicates that resources in your Lab are in the process of being provisioned and tested. Your Lab is NOT READY yet, but this email will give an estimate of when your Lab will be available.

The second email will be sent to you when your Lab is fully provisioned, tested and READY for you to connect. In this email you'll find the information required by AnyConnect to establish a VPN connection to your Lab (Network IP Address, VPN Username, VPN Password).
