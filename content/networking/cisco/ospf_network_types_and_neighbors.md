The OSPF Broadcast Network Type

default to use network type broadcast

Attempt to discover neighbors by sending OSPF Hellos to the 224.0.0.5 multicast address (an address reserved for sending packets to all OSPF routers in the subnet)

Attempt to elect a DR and BDR on each subnet

On the interface with no other routers on the subnet (G0/1), become the DR

On the interface with three other routers on the subnet (G0/0), be either DR, BDR, or a DROther router

all discovered routers on the link should become neighbors and at least reach the 2-way state. For all neighbor relationships that include the DR and/or BDR, the neighbor relationship should further reach the full state. That section defined the term fully adjacent as a special term that refers to neighbors that reach this full state.

To see the setting, use the show ip ospf interface command, as shown in Example 21-4. The first highlighted item identifies the network type

ip ospf network broadcast interface subcommand would configure the setting.

Configuring to Influence the DR/BDR Election

If the DR fails, the BDR becomes the DR, and a new BDR is elected.

When a better router enters the subnet, no preemption of the existing DR or BDR occurs.

- Preemption: If a new router is configured to be the DR, it will not become the DR until the OSPF process is reset.

As a result of these rules, while you can configure a router to be the best (highest priority) router to become the DR in an election, doing so only increases that router’s statistical chances of being the DR at a given point in time. If the router fails, other routers will become DR and BDR, and the best router will not be DR again until the current DR and BDR fail.

The highest OSPF interface priority: The highest value wins during an election, with values ranging from 0 to 255.

The highest OSPF Router ID: If the priority ties, the election chooses the router with the highest OSPF RID.

If an engineer preferred that R1 be the DR, the engineer could add the configuration in Example 21-5 to set R1’s interface priority to 99. (default of 1)

OSPF Neighbor Relationships

They must have compatible values for several settings as listed in the Hellos exchanged between the two routers

Requirement 
Interfaces must be in an up/up state. 
Access control lists (ACL) must not filter 
routing protocol messages. 
Interfaces must be in the same subnet. 
They must pass routing protocol neigh- 
bor authentication (if configured). 
Hello and hold/dead timers must match. 
Router IDs (RID) must be unique. 
They must be in the same area. 
OSPF process must not be shut down.

For items listing a “yes” in this column, if that item is configured incorrectly, the neighbor will not appear in lists of OSPF neighbors—for instance, with the show ip ospf neighbor command.

the last section (shaded) lists a couple of OSPF settings that give a different symptom when incorrect

for these two items, when incorrect, a router can list the other router as a neighbor, but the neighbor relationship does not work properly in that the routers do not exchange LSAs as they should

Requirement 
Hello and dead timers must match. 
They must be in the same area. 
RIDs must be unique. 
They must pass any neighbor 
authentication. 
OSPF process must not be shut down.

Finding Area Mismatches

Check the output of show running-config to look for

ip ospf process-id area area-number interface subcommands

network commands in OSPF configuration mode

Use the show ip ospf interface \[brief\] command to list the area number

Finding Duplicate OSPF Router IDs

both routers automatically generate a log message for the duplicate OSPF RID problem between R1 and R3;

show ip ospf commands on both R3 and R1 to easily list the RID on each router,

use the router-id 3.3.3.3 OSPF subcommand and use the EXEC mode command clear ip ospf process. (OSPF will not begin using a new RID value until the process restarts, either via command or reload.)

Finding OSPF Hello and Dead Timer Mismatches

Hello interval/timer: The per-interface timer that tells a router how often to send OSPF Hello messages on an interface.

Dead interval/timer: The per-interface timer that tells the router how long to wait without having received a Hello from a neighbor before believing that neighbor has failed. (Defaults to four times the Hello timer.)

Shutting Down the OSPF Process

When a routing protocol process is shut down, IOS does the following:

Brings down all neighbor relationships and clears the OSPF neighbor table

Clears the LSDB

Clears the IP routing table of any OSPF-learned routes

IOS retains all OSPF configuration.

IOS still lists all OSPF-enabled interfaces in the OSPF interface list (show ip ospf interface) but in a DOWN state.

Mismatched MTU Settings

defining the largest network layer packet that the router will forward out each interface.

default MTU size of 1500 bytes,

The ip mtu size interface subcommand defines the IPv4 MTU setting, and the ipv6 mtu size command sets the equivalent for IPv6 packets.

Symptom: they fail to exchange their LSDBs. Eventually, after trying and failing to exchange their LSDBs, the neighbor relationship also fails.

show interfaces command (which lists the IP MTU).

Mismatched OSPF Network Types

one router uses broadcast, and the other uses point-to-point, the following occurs:

The two routers become fully adjacent neighbors (that is, they reach a full state).

They exchange their LSDBs.

They do not add IP routes to the IP routing table.
