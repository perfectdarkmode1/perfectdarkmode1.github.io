Expressions consist of values (such as 2) and operators (such as +), and they can always evaluate (that is, reduce) down to a single value.

A single value with no operators is also considered an expression, though it evaluates only to itself, as shown here:

>>> 2

2

Whitespace in between the operators and values doesnâ€™t matter for Python (except for the indentation at the beginning of the line), but a single space is convention
