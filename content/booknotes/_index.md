This was a very insightful book. Knowing the balance between pain and pleasure is essential to living in modern day society. Where scarcity is no longer an issue. Our brains are not adapted for a world of abundance. So the forces that kept us alive for thousands of years, are now making us miserable. Consider this a primer into understanding addiction and over consumption. And steps you can take to mitigate this. [Read my notes](Dopamine_Nation.md)

This second half of the book was almost an identical copy of the second half of the book. But still filled with solid advice on establishing a vision, settings goals, measuring the effectiveness of your actions, and other tidbits about being effective and taking action. 

I have been implementing most of this and needed to go back through to make sure I've got down the process. 

I highly advise you make your own outline so you do not have to read everything "twice again". [Read my notes](The_12_Week_Year)
