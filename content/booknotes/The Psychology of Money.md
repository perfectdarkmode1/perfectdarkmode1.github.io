title: The Psychology of Money 
---
You don't have to be a genius to do well with money. You just need to have the proper set of emotional and behavioral skills. These skills have nothing to do with having a finance degree. 

You must factor in Luck when making financial decisions. 

What seems like a dumb financial decision to one person, may be smart from someone else's point of view. Depending on their life outlook, their mental model of the world, goals, and current circumstances.  

The world is too complex for an individual to dictate 100% of their outcomes. Remember luck and risk when judging others (or your own) financial success. 

People can get lucky when they just as well could have leaned toward the side of risk. Even if it was the same decisions. the outcome could have swayed either way. 

Based on this, careful when judging or looking up to people. Not all successful people got there because of hard work, and not all poverty is due to lazyness. 

Extreme cases of luck and risk cannot be applied to other people. The farther the extreme, the more likely the outcome was driven by luck and risk. So focus more on broad patterns, rather than on individuals or case studies. Common patterns are more likely to be applicable to your life. 

When things are good or bad, realize that luck or risk played a huge part in bringing you there. Both factors can turn your life around just as quick.
