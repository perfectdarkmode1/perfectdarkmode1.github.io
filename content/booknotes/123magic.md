# The 3 jobs for you as a parent

1.  Control obnoxious Behavior (STOP behaviors)
2.  Encourage good behavior (START behaviors)
3.  Strengthening your relationship with your children

# Controlling obnoxious behavior (STOP Behaviors)

This is where counting and break times come in. You will use counting and break times for STOP behaviors.

## Taking Breaks and Counting

A break is when parents and child can separate briefly so they can calm down and regroup. You do not talk about the behavior after the break. No need to punish the child twice. If the behavior was dangerous, unusual, or new, then give a brief explanation.

3 counts are needed before a break occurs. And after you've tried ignoring, sympathetic listening, distraction, and joint problem solving.

You and your child may fall for the arguing/ yelling/ hitting/ persuading/ defending/ rationalizing trap. You need to start counting before this happens. Once you notice that you've fallen in this trap. Simply go back to counting.

The parents tone should not be anger/ negative. It should simply be "I love you but you simply cannot behave this way".

## Straight to 3!

Major behavior goes straight to 3 and taking a break. This is stuff like hitting, spitting, etc. Still, you must be gentle and consistent. Then the child's behavior will mature over time.

Your child won't behave rationally when they are upset. Same goes to you! The brain is just not wired that way. When dealing with a child, you must manage the yelling/ screaming/ whining/ fighting. All while encouraging positive behaviors like eating, doing homework, cleaning up, going to bed and child/parent bonding.

To be an effective parent you must be gentle and friendly. The message your child receives should be that you love them and will take care of them.

You must also balance this with being firm and letting them know that you expect them to do something.

Children also will model your behavior. Like if you solve problems with anger. They will to. If you are calm and collected. They will learn that from you as well.

## Counting is for STOP behaviors

You must control negative behaviors. These are things you want your children to STOP doing. And what you will use COUNTING for.

-   Physical attacks on people , breaking something, fighting
    
-   Teasing
    
-   Whining
    
-   Temper (intimidation, "I HATE YOU!")
    
-   Arguing
    
-   Badgering (wearing you down with repetition
    
-   Tantrums
    
-   Yelling
    
-   Threat (I'm running away from home)
    
-   Martyrdom ("I never get anything")
    
-   Crying, pouting, looking sad on purpose
    
-   Saying something is unfair
    
-   Butter up "you are the nicest dad in the world!"
    
-   Promises/ insincere apologies
    

This is controlling obnoxious behavior. Or the demanding side of parenting. This teaches you and your child to hold back and avoid dysfunctional responses.

Methods for stop behaviors

### Counting

1.  Go straight to 3 if behavior is dangerous or extreme
2.  Don't talk or get angry, just count
3.  Voice should be casual but stern
4.  No extra talking or emotion
5.  Things should go back to normal after a count
6.  Counting with anger is challenging your child to misbehave
7.  Both parents can be involved in any of the counts (mom says 1 for first offense dad says 2, etc.)
8.  Keep quit and ignore for minor offenses (depending on your fuse)
9.  When in doubt count
10.  Take about 5 seconds between counts
11.  Start the counting cycle over longer as the child gets older. (15 minutes for 5 year old, 2-3 hours for an 11 year old, etc.
12.  Do not punish bad grades, use the reward system for grades instead.
13.  Explain to child the counting process when you first start.
14.  Should not be used for bedtime

### Break time

1.  One minute per year of the child's life
2.  Do not make eye contact or talk to child
3.  Remain gentle but firm and instructive
4.  You do not have to close the door
5.  No lectures, explanations, or emotions after a break time
6.  Explanations are appropriate when the behavior is new, unusual, or dangerous
7.  Very gentle procedure to calm everyone down
8.  If child behaves, praise him and enjoy his company, if they do something else that is countable, count it.
9.  Parent should not be furious, yelling, lecturing, or physical or emotionally abusive
10.  Most failures are because the parent forgets the no talking and no emotion rules
11.  Timer doesn't start until child is done with tantrum (unless they are 3 or younger, then just let them out when their time is up, start the count over if they continue to misbehave after they get out)
12.  Child can go to room and read, take a nap, play legos, draw, etc. No phone, no friends, and no electronic entertainment.
13.  Use same strategy if company is over
14.  Send kid and friend outside if they both get counted to 3
15.  Give child a hug after break time if they want one.
16.  Should happen right when the offense happens. Do not give a break time an hour later for something. If you can't give a breaktime right away then use a breaktime alternative.

What if kids won't go to break time?

1.  Bring them to the room
2.  Choose a breaktime Alternative (you can give them a choice between a couple consequences, you pick if they won't)
3.  Reverse break time, you leave the room, walk around the house, don’t talk
4.  If they won't come out of breaktime, that is okay, just tell them when their time is up

What if they leave their room?

1.  Add extra time
2.  Switch to break time alternative
3.  Doorknob cover
4.  Locking the door
5.  Tell them if they come out then the door gets closed
