This is a page to help me stay focused and keep track of what I am doing. It is also to show others what I am currently working on and thinking about. Credit goes to Derrick Sivers for starting a "Now" page movement. Read about "Now" pages [here](https://nownownow.com/about).

## What I am Reading

## Health

I am currently slowly tapering off of caffeine by -25mg per week. Current Daily: 375mg

Also running every other day at least two miles.

Focusing on eating higher fat ratio by filling my diet with Nuts and seeds. And keeping fruit and vegetables, beans, etc. as a staple. 

## Relationships

Focusing on being more present with the family. And for me that means no distractions like social media or working during family time. 

## Things to Learn

I keep a page of projects that I want to do and tech that I want to learn [here.](/now/Projects.md) Then, instead of trying to learn every new shiny thing as it pops up. I continue to focus on my current goal.
