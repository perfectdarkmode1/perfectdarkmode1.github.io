This is a page to help me stay focused and keep track of what I am doing. It is also to show others what I am currently working on and thinking about. Credit goes to Derrick Sivers for starting a "Now" page movement. Read about "Now" pages [here](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Things to Learn

I keep a page of projects that I want to do and tech that I want to learn [here.](/now/Projects.md) Then, instead of trying to learn every new shiny thing as it pops up. I continue to focus on my current goal. 

## Plans for my website
- [x] Build out basic theme and layout. 
- [x] Add picture to about page.
- [x] Make a "Recommended Reading" page with recommended books, and a picture of the book covers.
