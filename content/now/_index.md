# What I am Doing Now

This is a page to help me stay focused and keep track of what I am doing. It is also to show others what I am currently working on and thinking about. Credit goes to Derrick Sivers for starting a "Now" page movement. Read about "Now" pages [here](https://nownownow.com/about).
