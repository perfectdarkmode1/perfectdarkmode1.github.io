Here are my highlights pulled up in Vim:

As you can see, Bookfusion gives you a lok of extra information when you export highlights. First, let's get rid of the lines that begin with `##`

Enter command mode in Vim by pressing `esc`. Then type `:g/^##/d` and press enter.

Much better.

Now let's get rid of the color references:`
`:g/^Color/d`

To get rid of the timestamps, we must find a different commonality between the lines. In this case, each line ends with "UTC". Let's match that: `g/UTC$/d`

Where `$` matches the end of the line.

Now, I want to get rid of the `> ` on each line: 
`%s/> //g`

Almost there, you'll notice there are 6 empty lines in between each highlight. Let's shrink those down into one: 
`:%s/\(\n\)\{3,}/\r\r/g`

The command above matches newline character `n` 3 or more times and replaces them with two newline characters `/r/r`.

As we scroll down, I see a few weird artifacts from the book conversion to markdown.

Now, I want to get rid of any carrot brackets in the file. Let's use the substitute command again here:
`%s/<//g`

Depending on your book and formatting. You may have some other stuff to edit.
