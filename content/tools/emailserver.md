Make sure your VSP unblocks port 25

Allow ports using your firewall
```bash
ufw allow 25/tcp
ufw allow 587/tcp
```

Install mailutils

```bash
apt install -y mailutils postfix
```

Select "internet site" in the gui.

Then enter your domain name "example.com"

## Reverse DNS (rDNS)

Email servers may require a PTR record to prevent spam

In vultr (VPS) make sure your reverse DNS is set to your domain name. Do this for both ipv4 and ipv6 under settings.

## DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)

Used to prevent people from changing their from address.

Open DKIM is a tool that creates cryptographic public and private keys for your server. This way yopu emails can be trusted. Other servers can check your public key to make sure you are really you. 

You will also need server-side authorization settings to verify which account the email came from. 

```sh
apt install opendkim opendkim-tools
```

Generate DKIM Key, create directory, and edit permissions.

```sh
mkdir -p /etc/postfix/dkim
opendkim-genkey -D /etc/postfix/dkim/ -d example.org -s mail
chgrp opendkim /etc/postfix/dkim/*
chmod g+r /etc/postfix/dkim/*
```

Create the key table

tell OpenDKIM where the keys are

```sh
echo "mail._domainkey.example.org example.org:mail:/etc/postfix/dkim/mail.private" > /etc/postfix/dkim/keytable
```

Create signing table

```sh
echo "*@example.org mail._domainkey.example.org" > /etc/postfix/dkim/signingtable
```

Add trusted hosts
```sh
echo "127.0.0.1
10.1.0.0/16
1.2.3.4/24" > /etc/postfix/dkim/trustedhosts
```

OpenDKIM configuration file 

open up `/etc/opendkim.conf`
add these lines to source the files created above
```yaml
KeyTable file:/etc/postfix/dkim/keytable
SigningTable refile:/etc/postfix/dkim/signingtable
InternalHosts refile:/etc/postfix/dkim/trustedhosts

Canonicalization        relaxed/simple
Socket                  inet:12301@localhost
```

the socket option will already be set in the configuration file. COmment it out or overwrite this. 

## Allowing postfix to interface with OPenDKIM

set our OpenDKIM server, which will be running on port `12301`, as a milter (mail filter).

```sh
postconf -e "myhostname = $(cat /etc/mailname)"
postconf -e "milter_default_action = accept"
postconf -e "milter_protocol = 6"
postconf -e "smtpd_milters = inet:localhost:12301"
postconf -e "non_smtpd_milters = inet:localhost:12301"
```

Restart and reload the services

```sh
systemctl restart opendkim
systemctl enable opendkim
systemctl reload postfix
```

## Add key as TXT record in your registrar

Grab the key

```sh
echo -e "

v=DKIM1; k=rsa; $(tr -d "
" </etc/postfix/dkim/mail.txt | sed "s/k=rsa.* \"p=/k=rsa; p=/;s/\"\s*\"//;s/\"\s*).*//" | grep -o "p=.*")

"
```

Grab the key that starts with v=DKIM1 and enter it as the TXT Value for the record.

enter the host name:
mail._domainkey

Test 
```sh
echo "Hi there.

This is the text." | mail -s "Email from the server" your@emailaddress.com
```

## DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication Protocol)

Give email domain owners the ability to protect your domain from unauthorized use.

Add the dmarc user:

```
useradd -m -G mail dmarc
```

make a new TXT record like we did with DKIM, except now use the output from the following command:

```
echo "_dmarc.$(cat /etc/mailname)"
echo "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@$(cat /etc/mailname); fo=1"
```

The first line is the Host field. The latter is the TXT value.

### Sender Policy Framework

Saving the easiest for last, we should add a TXT record for SPF, an email-authentication standard used to prevent spammers from sending messages that appear to come from a spoofed domain.

```
cat /etc/mailname
echo "v=spf1 mx a:mail.$(cat /etc/mailname) -all"
```

The output of `cat /etc/mailname` is the Host field. The output of the second command is the TXT value.

Again, you can check [that site](https://appmaildev.com/en/spf) to make sure your DKIM, DMARC, and SPF entries are valid. That’s it!

# Setting up an E-mail Inbox

In the article on [SMTP and Postfix](https://landchad.net/mail/smtp), we set up a simple Postfix server that we could use to programatically send mail with the `mail` command. In order to have a true and fully-functional mail server, users should be able to login to a mail client where they can read their inbox and send mail remotely. In order to achieve this we need Dovecot, which can store mails received by the server, authenticate user accounts and interact with mail.

If we’re setting up an inbox we will also want spam detection software, such as spam assassin.

## Dovecot and Spamassassin

```
apt install dovecot-imapd dovecot-sieve spamassassin spamc
```

Unblock the imap port:

```
ufw allow 993
```

## Certificate

We will want a SSL certificate for the `mail.` subdomain. We can get this with [Certbot](https://landchad.net/basic/certbot/). Assuming we are using Nginx for our server otherwise, run:

```
certbot --nginx certonly -d mail.example.org
```

## DNS

We also need two little DNS records set on your domain registrar’s site/DNS server:

1.  An MX record. Just put your domain, **example.org**, in the “Points to” field.
2.  A CNAME record. Host field: **mail.example.org**. “Points to” field: **example.org.**

## Configuring Dovecot

Dovecot's configuration file is in `/etc/dovecot/docevot.conf`. If you open that file, you will see this line: `!include conf.d/*.conf` which adds all the `.conf` files in `/etc/dovecot/conf.d/` to the Dovecot configuration.

One can edit each of these files individually to get the needed configuration, but to make things easy here, delete or backup the main configuration file and we will replace it with one single config file with all important settings in it. Make sure you change `ssl_cert` and `ssl_key` accordingly.

```wide
# Note that in the dovecot conf, you can use:
# %u for username
# %n for the name in name@domain.tld
# %d for the domain
# %h the user's home directory

# Connections between the mail client and Dovecot needs to be encrypted
ssl = required
ssl_cert = </etc/letsencrypt/live/mail.example.org/fullchain.pem
ssl_key = </etc/letsencrypt/live/mail.example.org/privkey.pem
ssl_min_protocol = TLSv1.2
ssl_cipher_list = EECDH+ECDSA+AESGCM:EECDH+aRSA+AESGCM:EECDH+ECDSA+SHA256:EECDH+aRSA+SHA256:EECDH+ECDSA+SHA384:EECDH+ECDSA+SHA256:EECDH+aRSA+SHA384:EDH+aRSA+AESGCM:EDH+aRSA+SHA256:EDH+aRSA:EECDH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!EXP:!PSK:!SRP:!DSS:!RC4:!SEED
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers = yes
ssl_dh = </usr/share/dovecot/dh.pem
auth_mechanisms = plain login
auth_username_format = %n

protocols = $protocols imap

# Search for valid users in /etc/passwd
userdb {
    driver = passwd
}
#Fallback: Use plain old PAM to find user passwords
passdb {
    driver = pam
}

# Our mail for each user will be in ~/Mail, and the inbox will be ~/Mail/Inbox
mail_location = maildir:~/Mail:INBOX=~/Mail/Inbox:LAYOUT=fs
namespace inbox {
    inbox = yes
    mailbox Drafts {
    special_use = \Drafts
    auto = subscribe
}
    mailbox Junk {
    special_use = \Junk
    auto = subscribe
    autoexpunge = 30d
}
    mailbox Sent {
    special_use = \Sent
    auto = subscribe
}
    mailbox Trash {
    special_use = \Trash
}
    mailbox Archive {
    special_use = \Archive
}
}

# Here we let Postfix use Dovecot's authetication system.
service auth {
  unix_listener /var/spool/postfix/private/auth {
    mode = 0660
    user = postfix
    group = postfix
}
}

protocol lda {
  mail_plugins = \$mail_plugins sieve
}
protocol lmtp {
  mail_plugins = \$mail_plugins sieve
}
plugin {
	sieve = ~/.dovecot.sieve
	sieve_default = /var/lib/dovecot/sieve/default.sieve
	sieve_dir = ~/.sieve
	sieve_global_dir = /var/lib/dovecot/sieve/
}
```

### Settings Explained

Take a good look at the above settings to understand what's going on. Some of the settings include:

1.  SSL settings to allow encrypted connections.
2.  The mail server will authenticate users against PAM/passwd, which means users you create on the server (so long as they are part of the `mail` group) will be able to receive and send mail.
3.  Default directories for a mail account: Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Junk, Trash and Archive.
4.  Create a `unix_listener` that will allow Postfix to authenticate users via Dovecot.
5.  Setup the Dovecot sieve plugin, which provides mail filtering facilities at time of final message delivery. Sieve scripts can be used to customize how messages are delivered, whether they’re forwarded or stored in special folders.

Next, we can tell sieve to automatically move mail flagged as spam to the junk folder:

```
echo "require [\"fileinto\", \"mailbox\"];
if header :contains \"X-Spam-Flag\" \"YES\"
        {
                fileinto \"Junk\";
        }" > /var/lib/dovecot/sieve/default.sieve
```

After that, we should create the `vmail` user and group, which will access the mails, and then update the sieve configuration:

```
grep -q '^vmail:' /etc/passwd || useradd vmail
chown -R vmail:vmail /var/lib/dovecot
sievec /var/lib/dovecot/sieve/default.sieve
```

Then, enable pam authentication for Dovecot:

```
echo "auth    required        pam_unix.so nullok
account required        pam_unix.so" >> /etc/pam.d/dovecot
```

## Connecting Postfix and Dovecot

We need to tell Postfix to look to Dovecot for authenticating users/passwords. Dovecot will be putting an authentication socket in `/var/spool/postfix/private/auth`.

```
postconf -e 'smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes'
postconf -e 'smtpd_sasl_type = dovecot'
postconf -e 'smtpd_sasl_path = private/auth'
postconf -e 'mailbox_command = /usr/lib/dovecot/deliver'
```

## Connecting Postfix and Spamassassin

We will change `/etc/postifx/master.cf` so postfix can route mail through spamassassin. First we can cleanup the default configuration. Feel free to make a backup.

```
sed -i '/^\s*-o/d;/^\s*submission/d;/^\s*smtp/d' /etc/postfix/master.cf
```

Finally, run this command to finish the configuration for spamassassin.

```
echo "smtp unix - - n - - smtp
smtp inet n - y - - smtpd
  -o content_filter=spamassassin
submission inet n       -       y       -       -       smtpd
  -o syslog_name=postfix/submission
  -o smtpd_tls_security_level=encrypt
  -o smtpd_sasl_auth_enable=yes
  -o smtpd_tls_auth_only=yes
smtps     inet  n       -       y       -       -       smtpd
  -o syslog_name=postfix/smtps
  -o smtpd_tls_wrappermode=yes
  -o smtpd_sasl_auth_enable=yes
spamassassin unix -     n       n       -       -       pipe
  user=debian-spamd argv=/usr/bin/spamc -f -e /usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -f \${sender} \${recipient}" >> /etc/postfix/master.cf
```

## Make new mail accounts

This is the easy part. Let’s say we want to add a user Billy and let him receive mail, run this:

```
useradd -m -G mail billy
passwd billy
```

Any user added to the `mail` group will be able to receive mail. Suppose a user Cassie already exists and we want to let her receive mail too. Just run:

```
usermod -a -G mail cassie
```

# Harden your E-mail Server

## Hardening Postfix

Put restrictions on servers sending mail to you.

```
postconf -e 'smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated, permit_mynetworks, reject_unauth_destination, reject_unknown_recipient_domain'
```

## Anonymize Headers

Use some regular expressions to prevent some meta data like a client’s ip address from being leaked.

```
echo "/^Received:.*/     IGNORE
/^X-Originating-IP:/    IGNORE
/^User-Agent:/        IGNORE
/^X-Mailer:/        IGNORE" >> /etc/postfix/header_checks
```

Add this file to the postfix configuration:

```
postconf -e "header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks"
```

## Fail2Ban

If you’re not familiar with fail2Ban, it’s essentially a program which blocks bot’s and hacker’s login requests after a few invalid attempts.

```
apt-get install fail2ban
```

Make a local copy of the configuration file:

```
cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

Go down to the `# Mail servers` line and paste this:

```
[postfix]

enabled  = true
port     = smtp,ssmtp,submission
filter   = postfix
logpath  = /var/log/mail.log


[sasl]

enabled  = true
port     = smtp,ssmtp,submission,imap2,imap3,imaps,pop3,pop3s
filter   = postfix-sasl
# You might consider monitoring /var/log/mail.warn instead if you are
# running postfix since it would provide the same log lines at the
# "warn" level but overall at the smaller filesize.
logpath  = /var/log/mail.warn
maxretry = 1
bantime  = 21600

[dovecot]

enabled = true
port    = smtp,ssmtp,submission,imap2,imap3,imaps,pop3,pop3s
filter  = dovecot
logpath = /var/log/mail.log
```

This will only grant 2 login attempts and then block the requester for 6 hours. Now restart `fail2ban`:

```
systemctl restart fail2ban
```
