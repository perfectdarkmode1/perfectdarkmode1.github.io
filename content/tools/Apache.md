Basic authentication in Apache is configured in Location or Directory blocks


SSL might have changed its name to TLS

![](Pasted%20image%2020240402045643.png)

Here, the TLS certificate and key are located in Linux’s central system location, /etc/ssl. The public certificates can be readable by anyone, but the key should be accessible only to the Apache master-process user, typically root. We prefer to set permissions to 444 for the certificate and 400 for the key.

All versions of the actual SSL protocol (precursor to TLS) are known to be insecure and should be disabled with the SSLProtocol directive, shown above.

few ciphers have known weaknesses. You can configure the web server’s supported ciphers with the SSLCipherSuite directive


Mozilla Server Side TLS guide is the best resource that we are aware of for staying current

on best practices for TLS. It also has a handy configuration syntax reference for Apache, NGINX, and HAProxy.

added the ssl certs to the normal ssl fileand renamed to letsencryptkettest.ssl.conf

also moved the original ssl.conf to current.ssl.conf
