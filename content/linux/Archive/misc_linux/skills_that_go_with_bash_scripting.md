What are supplementary skills that go well with Bash Scripting for landing a job in Systems Administration?

I went through Dozens of job listings that mentioned Bash Scripting. I then tallied up devices/ vendors, certifications, and technologies mentioned. I left out anything that wasn't mentioned more than twice.

The point here is to target the most sought after technologies and skills by employers. And lastly, I left out soft skills and any job that wasn't a Systems Administration specific role.
