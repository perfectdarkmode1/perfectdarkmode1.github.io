Distributions

Debian

\- dpkg

\- GNU/Linux

\- Ubuntu

\- Rasbian

Major Open source apllications

software packages

Debian, Ubuntu, Linux mint

\- dpkg, apt-get, and apt package managers

\- deb packages

RedHat, Fedora, Centos

\- rpm, yum, and dnf package managers

\- rpm packages

Dependencies = auxiliary packages needed by programs

Individual package files operate on .dpkg and .rpm

Catalogues (works with)

\- apt get, apt, yum, dnf

\- download new packages and their dependencies

$ apt-cache search package-name

$ apt search package_name

\- used to search for apps

\- Installation and removal of packages requires admin

$ apt-get install package name

$ apt install package_name

\- two ways to install package in Debian systems

$ apt-get purge cups

\- uninstall program and config files

$ figlet Awesome

\- picture text program

RPM

$ yum search package_name

$ dnp

\- you can use descriptive terms to find programs by function

$ yum search speaking cow (finds cowsay)

$ cowsay “Linux is fun”

Uninstall a package (remove keyword) (sudo)

$ apt-get remove package_name

$ apt remove package_name

$ yum remove package_name

$ dnf remove package_name

\- config files of removed programs are kept in the system

Office Applications

\- both offer paid versions

\- can install on private server for free

\- must be installed on a configured web server

Network Administrat:cowboy: ion

DNS & DHCP

Programming Languages

\- source code - human readable text file that describes what the program is doing

\- compiled languages - source code is converted to a binary file that can be executed by the computer

\- Compiler - program that converts source code to executable form

\- interpereted languages- interpereter reads source code and executes it's instructions

Java Script

\- used for web pages

C (compiled)

\- closely related with operating systems

Java (compiled)

\- portable to other operating systems

Encryption

TLS (transport layer security)

\- succesor of SSL

\- provides privacy & authenticity using symmetric and public key cryptography

\- used with HTTPS

\- open source

\- sign, encrypt, and decrypt text, emails, files, directories, and disk partitions

\- public key for encrypting

\- private key for decrypting

Disk Encryption

\- encrypt whole disk or partition

\- two basic methods

\- stacked

\- block

Stacked

\- implemented on top of existing filesystem

\- stored encrypted

Block

\- Happens below filesystem layer

\- makes sure everything written to a block device is encrypted

\- metadata, directory structure and permissions are also encrypted

Dm-crypt

\- standard for block encryption for Linux

\- native in the kernel

\- can be used with LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup) extension

\- implements a platform-independent standard for use with various tools

EncFs

Stackable method

Veracrypt

\- multiplatform support
