2 types of commands

\- internal (~30 built in commands) (builtins)

\- External

\- reside in individual files

\- usually binary programs or scripts

\- shellusys PATH variable to find the command (the executable file)

Quoting

Double quotes

\- text in between is regular characters

\- except $ \ `

variables, command substitution and arithmetic still work

\- a space bar loses it's meaning as an argument seperator

Single Quotes

\- revoke special meaning from all characters in quotes

Escape Characters

\- takes special meaning out of characters

$ echo \\$USER

$ USER

\- .\ tells bash to ignore specialness of preceding character

Set a variable

$ $TWOWORDS

The PATH Variable

\- stores a list of directories that have executable commands

append new directory to PATH

$ PATH=$PATH:new_directory

append new directory to PATH using another variable
