Richard Stallman started working on the GNU (GNU is Not UNIX) project, the GNU kernel called Hurd, which unfortunately never came to completion. The GNU General Public License (GPL), a free software license, was also created as a result of this.

The Kernel allows hardware to talk to software.

A Linux system is divided into 3 main parts:

- Hardware - This includes all the hardware that your system runs on as well as memory, CPU, disks, etc.
- Linux Kernel - As we discussed above, the kernel is the core of the operating system. It manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with the system.
- User Space - This is where users like yourself will be directly interacting with the system.

Debian

Composed Entirely of free and open-source software.

3 branches

- Stable
- Testing (rolling)
- Unstable (rolling)

rolling: any incremental changes will eventually become stable. Wont have to do a full OS install to get next OS release.

Package Management
 

- Every distro installs and manages packages differently and use different package management tools.
