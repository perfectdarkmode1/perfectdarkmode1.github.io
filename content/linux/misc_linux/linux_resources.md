Going Down the Linux Rabbit Hole

Now that I have finished my CCNA, it's time to go down the Linux rabbit hole. I may or may not be getting any Linux certifications. I mostly just want a foundation of basic Linux and bash scripting skills. This will help expand the areas of technology that I am able to workÂ  with.

After searching Reddit and asking professionals on Discord, these are the beginner friendly resources for learning Linux that I came up with. It should be enough to get anyone started with the basics of Linux and bash.

After finishing all of these and practicing labs I may be a part 2 of this list so we can go even deeper.

The Top Recommended Linux Resource

This was the most recommended free resource for learning "Linux-Fu". And boy does it deliver. I am currently halfway into this website. It is helping a ton by building the foundations needed to move on to bash projects. LinuxJourney.com has 4 main categories:

- Grasshopper
- Journeyman
- Networking Nomad
- Recommended Resources

Grasshopper

Goes over Linux distributions, command line navigation, text programs, user management, permissions, processes and packages.

Journey man

Covers devices, filesystems, booting, kernel, init, process utilization, and logging.

Networking

Goes over basics like network sharing, subnetting, routing, network configuration, troubleshooting, and DNS.

Recommended resources

Gives four additional books to learn Linux.

Widely Recommended Book

[Linux Command Line and Shell Scripting Bible](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Command-Shell-Scripting-Bible/dp/111898384X/ref=sr_1_4?crid=23ZFYBA3DCPAN&keywords=linux+command+line+and+shell+scripting+bible&qid=1640795320&sprefix=linux+command+line+and+shell%2Caps%2C120&sr=8-4)

This book was recommended by pretty much everyone I talked to on Reddit. By the looks of it, it is filled with very practical knowledge and projects. The Shell Scripting Bible is separated into four parts:

- The Linux Command Line
- Shell Scripting Basics
- Advanced Shell Scripting
- Creating Practical Scripts

Epic Udemy Course

[Linux Shell Scripting: A Project-Based Approach to Learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-shell-scripting-projects/)

I like to include a video course in my learning. That is why I found a highly rated Udemy course. You can pick this course up for $12.86 when it is on sale. This will give some perspective on how to put all of this information about Linux to good use.

This project-based approach to learning includes:

- Creating a Local Linux Shell Scripting Environment
- User and Account Creation
- Password Generation and Shell Script Arguments
- Linux Programming Conventions
- Parsing Command Line Options
- Transforming Data/ Data Processing/ Reporting
- Network Scripting & Automation of Distributed Systems
- Some extras

I'm pretty excited about this one. Reading textbooks can be boring. Really needed a way to put Linux into practical use as fast as possible.

Why Linux?

Again, I'm not sure if any Linux certifications like Linux +, Linux Essentials, or LPIC-1 hold much weight. And I don't think I need to go as deep as an RHCSA in order to do Bash scripting. Please let me know if one of these basic Linux certs have changed your career.

I do think having some foundational Linux skills would boost anyone's resume and technical abilities. It will also give you the foundations to move onto Python scripting, ethical hacking, etc.

Well, there are your beginner friendly resources for learning Linux. Please let me know if there is anything else that should be on this list. I am after all, a Linux noob.
