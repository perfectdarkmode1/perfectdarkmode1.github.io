When you first download Fedora Workstation, it's going to be a little hard to figure out how to make it usable. Especially if you've never tinkered with Linux before.

Here is how to set up Fedora.


## Add badname user

`$ adduser --badname firstname.lastname`
`$ sudo usermod -aG wheel username`

```
# uncomment this line in the visudo file 
$ sudo visudo
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

Delete other user:

`$ userdel username`

## DNF Config (for speed)

DNF is one of the package managers that comes with Fedora. You use it to install most software and applications.

The official doc is [Here](https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conf_ref.html#description](https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conf_ref.html#description "https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conf_ref.html#description")
Just open up your DNF config file with your favorite text editor.

```
sudo nano /etc/dnf/dnf.conf
```

Then add the following:

```
fastestmirror=True  
max_parallel_downloads=10  
defaultyes=True  
keepcache=True
```

## Clear cache (do this occasionally)

`sudo dnf clean dbcache`
or `sudo dnf cleanall`

## Update DNF

`sudo dnf -y update`

## DNF commands

## RPM Fusion

More accessibility to various software packages.

## l2tp VPN
```
sudo dnf install xl2tpd

sudo dnf install NetworkManager-l2tp

sudo dnf install NetworkManager-l2tp-gnome

service NetworkManager restart
```

## Airpods not pairing Issue

remove from the pairing list, force them in pairing mode and pair them back.

This can be made easy with bluetoothctl.

1/ Just in case, restart the bluetooth service:

```
$ sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
$ systemctl status bluetooth 
```

2/ bluetoothctl is easier than the UI imo

```
$ bluetoothctl
[bluetooth] $ devices
Device 42:42:42:42:42:42 My AirPods <-- grab the name here
[bluetooth] $ remove 42:42:42:42:42:42 
```

Now, make sure your airpods are in the charging case, close the lid, wait 15 seconds, then open the lid. Press and hold the setup button on the case for up to 10 seconds. The status light should flash white, which means that your AirPods are ready to connect

3/ Pair them back

```
[bluetooth] $ pair 42:42:42:42:42:42 <--- add the same device from earlier 
```
