For this one, I read the book completely to get a birds eye view. Then I converted the chapters to Markdown pages. And started with chapter 1 and turned it into an outline. Doing any labs along the way. Then do the same for chapter 2


then go back and review chapter 1


then outline chapter 3 and do labs.
