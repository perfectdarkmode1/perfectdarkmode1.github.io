Looking to get started using Fedora or Red Hat operating systems?

This guide with get you started with the RHEL Graphical environment, file system, and essential commands to get started using Fedora, Red Hat, or other RHEL based systems. 
## RedHat (RHEL9) Graphical Environment (Wayland)

Redhat runs a graphical environment called Wayland. This is the foundation for running GUI apps. Wayland is a client/server display protocol. Which just means that the user (the client) requests a resource and the display manager (the server) serves those resources. 

Wayland is slowly replaced and older display protocol called "X". And has better graphics capabilities, features, and performance than X. And consists of a Display or Login manager and a Desktop environment. 

The Display/ Login manager presents the login screen for users to log in. Once you log in, you get to the pre-configured desktop manager or Desktop Environment (DE). The GNOME Display Manager. (GDM)


## File System and Directory Hierarchy 

The standard for the Linux filesystem is the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS). Which describes locations, names, and permissions for a variety of file types and directories.

The directory structure starts at the root. Which is notated by a "/". The top levels of the directory can be viewed by running the `ls` command on the root of the directory tree.

Size of the root file system is automatically determined by the installer program based on the available disk space when you select the default partitioning (it may be altered). Here is a listing of the contents of /:

```
$ ls /
afs  bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  lost+found  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  snap  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
```

Some of these directories hold static data such as commands, configuration files, kernel and device files, etc. And some hold dynamic data such as log and status files. 

There are three major categories of file systems. They are:

1. disk-based
2. network-based
3. memory-based

**Disk-based** files systems are physical media such as a hard drive or a USB flash drive and store information persistently. The root and boot file systems and both disk-based and created automatically when you select the default partitioning. 

**Network-Based** file systems are disk-based file systems that are shared over the network for remote access. (Also stored persistently)

**Memory-Based** filesystems are virtual. And are created automatically at system startup and destroyed when the system goes down.


### Key Directories in /

#### /etc (extended text configuration)
This directory contains system configuration files for systemd, LVM, and user shell startup template files.

As you can see, there is a lot of stuff here. 

#### /root
This is the default home directory for the root user.

#### /mnt 
/mnt is used to temporarily mount a file system.

#### /boot (Disk-Based)
This directory contains the Linux Kernel, as well as boot support and configuration files.

The size of /boot is determined by the installer program based on the available disk space when you select the default partitioning. It may be set to a different size during or after the installation.

#### /home
This is used to store user home directories and other user contents.

#### /opt (Optional)
This directory holds additional software that may need to be installed on the system. A sub directory is created for each installed software.

#### /usr (UNIX System Resources)
Holds most of the system files such as: 

##### /usr/bin
Binary directory for user executable commands

##### /usr/sbin
System binaries required at boot and system administration commands not intended for execution by normal users. This directory is not included in the default search path for normal users.

##### /usr/lib and /usr/lib64
Contain shared library routines required by many commands/programs located in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin. These are used by kernel and other applications and programs for their successful installation and operation.

/usr/lib directory also stores system initialization and service management programs. /usr/lib64 contains 64-bit shared library routines.

##### /usr/include
Contains header files for the C programming language.

##### /usr/local:
This is a system administrator repository for storing commands and tools. These commands not generally included with the original Linux distribution.


| Directory                           | Contains                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| /usr/local/bin                      | ecutables                                                          |
| /usr/local/etc                      | configuration files                                                |
| /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/lib64 | library routines                                                   |
| /usr/share                          | manual pages, documentation, sample templates, configuration files |

##### /usr/src:
This directory is used to store source code.

#### Variable Directory (/var)

For data that frequently changes while the system is operational. Such as log, status, spool, lock, etc. 

common sub directories in /var: 

##### /var/log
Contains most system log files. Such as boot logs, user logs, failed user logs, installation logs, cron logs, mail logs, etc.

##### /var/opt

- log, status, and other variable data files for additional software installed in /opt, t.

##### /var/spool
- print jobs, cron jobs, mail messages, and other queued items.

##### /var/tmp

- Large temporary files or temporary files that need to exist for longer periods of time than what is typically allowed in /tmp
- survive system reboots
- deleted if they are not accessed or modified for a period of 30 days.

#### Temporary Directory (/tmp)

- temporary files
- programs can create temporary files here during runtime or installation.
- These files survive system reboots and are automatically removed if they are not accessed or modified for a period of 10 days.

#### Devices File System (/dev)

- Device nodes for (physical  and virtual)
- Linux kernel talks to devices through device nodes.
- Device nodes are automatically created and deleted by the udevd service.

udevd service :: A Linux service for dynamic device management.

Two types of device files :: Character (or raw), and block.

kernel accesses devices using :: Character (or raw), and/or  block Device files.

#### Character devices

- Accessed serially.
- Console, serial printers, mice, keyboards, terminals, etc.

#### Block devices

- Accessed in a parallel fashion with data exchanged in blocks.
- Data on block devices is accessed randomly.
- Hard disk drives, optical drives, parallel printers, etc.

## Procfs File System (/proc)

- Config and status info on:
	- Kernel, CPU, memory, disks, partitioning, file systems, networking, running processes, etc.
- Zero-length pseudo files point to data maintained by the kernel in the memory.
- Interface to interact with kernel-maintained information.
- Contents created in memory at system boot time, updated during runtime, and destroyed at system shutdown.

## Runtime File System (/run)

- Data for processes running on the system.
	- /run/media
- Used to automatically mount external file systems (CD, DVD, flash USB.)
- Contents deleted at shutdown.

## The System File System (/sys)

- Info about hardware devices, drivers, and some kernel features.
- Used by the kernel to load necessary support for devices, create device nodes in /dev, and configure devices.
- Auto-maintained.
# Essential System Commands

### tree command
- List hierarchy of directories and files.
- Column 2
	- Size.
-  Column 3
	- Full path.

Options.
	tree -a :: Include hidden files in the output.
	tree -d :: Exclude files from the output.
	tree -h :: Displays file sizes in human-friendly format.
	tree -f :: Prints the full path for each file.
	tree -p :: Includes file permissions in the output

## Labs

### List only the directories (-d) in the root user’s home directory (/root).
```
tree -d /root
```

### List files in the /etc/sysconfig directory along with their permissions, sizes in human-readable format, and full path.
```
tree -phf /etc/sysconfig
```

### View tree man pages.
```
man tree
```

# Prompt Symbols
- Hash sign (#) for root user.
- Dollar sign ($) for normal users.

# Linux Commands

Two types of commands:
1. User 
	- General purpose.
	- For any user.
2. System Management
	- Superuser.
	- Require elevated privileges.

# Command Mechanics

Basic Syntax
- command option(s) argument(s)
- Many commands have preconfigured default options and arguments. 

An option that starts with a single hyphen character (-la, for instance) ::: Short-option format.

- Two hyphen characters (--all, for instance)  ::: Long-option format.
## Listing Files and Directories

## ls 

- ll :: shortcut for ls -l 

Flags
ls -l ::: View long listing format.
ls -d ::: View info on the specified directory.
ls -h ::: Human readable format.
ls -a ::: List all files, including the hidden files.
ls -t ::: Sort output by date and time with the newest file first.
ls -R ::: List contents recursively.
ls -i ::: View inode information.
### labs:

#### Show the long listing of only /usr without showing its contents.
```
ls -ld /usr
```

#### Display all files in the current directory with their sizes in human-friendly format.
```
ls -lh
```

#### List all files, including the hidden files, in the current directory with detailed information.
```
ls -la
```

#### Sort output by date and time with the newest file first. 
```
ls -lt
```

#### List contents of the /etc directory recursively.
```
ls -R /etc
```

#### List directory info and the contents of a directory recursively.
```
ls -lR /etc
```

#### View ls manpage.
```
man ls
```

### Printing Working Directory (pwd) command

- Returns the absolute path to a file or directory.

## Navigating Directories

Absolute path (full path or a fully qualified pathname) :: Points to a file or directory in relation to the top of the directory tree. It always starts with the forward slash (/).

Relative path :: Points to a file or directory in relation to your current location.

### Labs:

#### Go one level up into the parent directory using the relative path
```
cd ..
```

#### cd into /etc/sysconfig using the absolute path (/etc/sysconfig), or the relative path (etc/sysconfig) 
```
cd /etc/sysconfig
cd /
cd etc/sysconfig
```

#### Change into the /usr/bin directory from /etc/sysconfig using relative or absolute path 
```
cd /usr/bin
```
or
```
cd ../usr/bin
```

#### Return to your home directory
```
cd
```
or
```
cd ~
```

#### Use the absolute path to change into the home directory of the root user from /etc/sysconfig
```
cd ../../root
```

#### Switch between the current and previous directories 
```
cd ..
```

#### use the cd command to print the home directory of the current user
```
cd -
```

# Terminal Device Files

- Unique pseudo (or virtual) numbered device files that represent terminal sessions opened by users.
- Used to communicate with individual sessions. 
- Stored in the /dev/pts/ (pseudo terminal session).
- Created  when a user opens a new terminal session.
- Removed when a session closes.


## tty command

- Identify current terminal session.
- Displays filename and location.
- Example: /dev/pts/0

# Inspecting System’s Uptime and Processor Load

## uptime command

- Displays:
	- System’s current time.
	- System up time.
	- Number of users currently logged in.
	- Average % CPU load over the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes. 
		- 0.00 and 1.00 represent no load and full load.
		- Greater than 1.00 signifies excess load (over 100%).

### clear command 
- Clears the terminal screen and places the cursor at the top left of the screen.
- Can also use Ctrl+l for this command.
```
clear
```
