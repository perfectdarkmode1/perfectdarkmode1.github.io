# Chapter 2 RHCSA Notes - Interaction

## Linux Graphical Environment

## Wayland
- Client/server display protocol. 
- Foundation for running GUI apps.
- Better graphics capabilities, features, and performance than X.

### Core Components

- Display manager (login manager)
- Desktop environment

### Display/ Login Manager 
- Presentation of graphical login screen
- Allows users to enter credentials to log on to the system
- Preconfigured graphical desktop manager appears after the credentials are verified

- Default display manager for RHEL8 :: GNOME Display Manager (GDM).

#### Desktop Environment 

- After login, the display/login manager establishes a Desktop Environment (DE).

# Linux Directory Structure and Filesystems

Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) :: Describes names, locations, and permissions for many file types and directories.

## Top-Level Directories

- Key top-level directories under /
- Some of these directories hold static data
- Others contain dynamic (or variable) information.

### Static directories

- commands
- configuration files
- library routines
- kernel files
- device files

### Dynamic directories 

- log files
- status files
- temporary files\

## File System Categories

Three groups: 
- disk-based
- network-based
- memory-based

### Disk-based 

- created on physical media such as a hard drive or a USB flash drive
- store information persistently

two disk-based file systems that  are created when you select the default partitioning :: root and boot file systems.
### Network Based

- disk-based file systems that are shared over the network for remote access.
- store information persistently

### Memory Based

- virtual; created automatically at system startup and destroyed when the system goes down.
- lost at system reboots.

## Root File System (/), Disk-Based

Size of the root file system is automatically determined by the installer program based on the available disk space when you select the default partitioning (it may be altered)

### Key Directories:

#### /etc 
- etcetera (extended text configuration)
- system configuration files
- common subdirectories
	systemd
	sysconfig
	lvm
	skel
-   comprise configuration files for systemd
-   most system services
-   Logical Volume Manager
-   per-user shell startup template files

/root :: default home directory for the root user

/mnt :: used to temporarily mount a file system

#### Boot File System (/boot), Disk-Based 

- Linux kernel
- boot support files
- boot configuration files
- size determined by the installer program based on the available disk space when you select the default partitioning
- may be set to a different size during or after the installation

#### The Home Directory (/home) 

- store user home directories and other user contents.

#### The Optional Directory (/opt) 

- hold additional software that may need to be installed on the system
- subdirectory is created for each installed software.

#### UNIX System Resources Directory (/usr)

- most of the system files.

##### /usr/bin
- binary directory
- crucial user executable commands.

##### /usr/sbin
- Most commands are required at system boot,
- system binary
- crucial system administration commands not intended for execution by normal users (although they can still run a few of them).
- not included in the default search path for normal users

##### /usr/lib and /usr/lib64
- shared library routines
- required by many commands/programs located in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
- used by kernel and other applications and programs for their successful installation and operation
- /usr/lib directory also stores system initialization and service management programs
- /usr/lib64 contains 64-bit shared library routines.

##### /usr/include
- header files for C language.

##### /usr/local:
- system administrator repository for storing commands and tools
- commands not generally included with the original Linux distribution.
	/usr/local/bin
		executables
	/usr/local/etc
		configuration files
	/usr/local/lib and /usr/local/lib64
		holds library routines.
	/usr/share:
		directory location for manual pages, documentation, sample templates, configuration files, etc.
		may be shared with other Linux platforms.

##### /usr/src:
- used to store source code.

#### Variable Directory (/var)

- data that frequently changes while the system is operational.
- log, status, spool, lock, and other dynamic data.

common subdirectories

##### /var/log
- Most system log files
- system logs, boot logs, user logs, failed user logs, installation logs, cron logs, mail logs, etc.

##### /var/opt

- log, status, and other variable data files for additional software installed in /opt, t.

##### /var/spool
- print jobs, cron jobs, mail messages, and other queued items.

##### /var/tmp

- Large temporary files or temporary files that need to exist for longer periods of time than what is typically allowed in /tmp
- survive system reboots
- deleted if they are not accessed or modified for a period of 30 days.

#### Temporary Directory (/tmp)

- temporary files
- programs can create temporary files here during runtime or installation.
- These files survive system reboots and are automatically removed if they are not accessed or modified for a period of 10 days.

#### Devices File System (/dev)

- Device nodes for (physical  and virtual)
- Linux kernel talks to devices through device nodes.
- Device nodes are automatically created and deleted by the udevd service.

udevd service :: A Linux service for dynamic device management.

Two types of device files :: Character (or raw), and block.

kernel accesses devices using :: Character (or raw), and/or  block Device files.

#### Character devices

- Accessed serially.
- Console, serial printers, mice, keyboards, terminals, etc.

#### Block devices

- Accessed in a parallel fashion with data exchanged in blocks.
- Data on block devices is accessed randomly.
- Hard disk drives, optical drives, parallel printers, etc.

## Procfs File System (/proc)

- Config and status info on:
	- Kernel, CPU, memory, disks, partitioning, file systems, networking, running processes, etc.
- Zero-length pseudo files point to data maintained by the kernel in the memory.
- Interface to interact with kernel-maintained information.
- Contents created in memory at system boot time, updated during runtime, and destroyed at system shutdown.

## Runtime File System (/run)

- Data for processes running on the system.
	- /run/media
- Used to automatically mount external file systems (CD, DVD, flash USB.)
- Contents deleted at shutdown.

## The System File System (/sys)

- Info about hardware devices, drivers, and some kernel features.
- Used by the kernel to load necessary support for devices, create device nodes in /dev, and configure devices.
- Auto-maintained.
# Essential System Commands

### tree command
- List hierarchy of directories and files.
- Column 2
	- Size.
-  Column 3
	- Full path.

Options.
	tree -a :: Include hidden files in the output.
	tree -d :: Exclude files from the output.
	tree -h :: Displays file sizes in human-friendly format.
	tree -f :: Prints the full path for each file.
	tree -p :: Includes file permissions in the output

## Labs

### List only the directories (-d) in the root userâ€™s home directory (/root).
```
tree -d /root
```

### List files in the /etc/sysconfig directory along with their permissions, sizes in human-readable format, and full path.
```
tree -phf /etc/sysconfig
```

### View tree man pages.
```
man tree
```

# Prompt Symbols
- Hash sign (#) for root user.
- Dollar sign ($) for normal users.

# Linux Commands

Two types of commands:
1. User 
	- General purpose.
	- For any user.
2. System Management
	- Superuser.
	- Require elevated privileges.

# Command Mechanics

Basic Syntax
- command option(s) argument(s)
- Many commands have preconfigured default options and arguments. 

An option that starts with a single hyphen character (-la, for instance) ::: Short-option format.

- Two hyphen characters (--all, for instance)  ::: Long-option format.
## Listing Files and Directories

## ls 

- ll :: shortcut for ls -l 

Flags
ls -l ::: View long listing format.
ls -d ::: View info on the specified directory.
ls -h ::: Human readable format.
ls -a ::: List all files, including the hidden files.
ls -t ::: Sort output by date and time with the newest file first.
ls -R ::: List contents recursively.
ls -i ::: View inode information.
### labs:

#### Show the long listing of only /usr without showing its contents.
```
ls -ld /usr
```

#### Display all files in the current directory with their sizes in human-friendly format.
```
ls -lh
```

#### List all files, including the hidden files, in the current directory with detailed information.
```
ls -la
```

#### Sort output by date and time with the newest file first. 
```
ls -lt
```

#### List contents of the /etc directory recursively.
```
ls -R /etc
```

#### List directory info and the contents of a directory recursively.
```
ls -lR /etc
```

#### View ls manpage.
```
man ls
```

### Printing Working Directory (pwd) command

- Returns the absolute path to a file or directory.

## Navigating Directories

Absolute path (full path or a fully qualified pathname) :: Points to a file or directory in relation to the top of the directory tree. It always starts with the forward slash (/).

Relative path :: Points to a file or directory in relation to your current location.

### Labs:

#### Go one level up into the parent directory using the relative path
```
cd ..
```

#### cd into /etc/sysconfig using the absolute path (/etc/sysconfig), or the relative path (etc/sysconfig) 
```
cd /etc/sysconfig
cd /
cd etc/sysconfig
```

#### Change into the /usr/bin directory from /etc/sysconfig using relative or absolute path 
```
cd /usr/bin
```
or
```
cd ../usr/bin
```

#### Return to your home directory
```
cd
```
or
```
cd ~
```

#### Use the absolute path to change into the home directory of the root user from /etc/sysconfig
```
cd ../../root
```

#### Switch between the current and previous directories 
```
cd ..
```

#### use the cd command to print the home directory of the current user
```
cd -
```

# Terminal Device Files

- Unique pseudo (or virtual) numbered device files that represent terminal sessions opened by users.
- Used to communicate with individual sessions. 
- Stored in the /dev/pts/ (pseudo terminal session).
- Created  when a user opens a new terminal session.
- Removed when a session closes.


## tty command

- Identify current terminal session.
- Displays filename and location.
- Example: /dev/pts/0

# Inspecting Systemâ€™s Uptime and Processor Load

## uptime command

- Displays:
	- Systemâ€™s current time.
	- System up time.
	- Number of users currently logged in.
	- Average % CPU load over the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes. 
		- 0.00 and 1.00 represent no load and full load.
		- Greater than 1.00 signifies excess load (over 100%).

### clear command 
- Clears the terminal screen and places the cursor at the top left of the screen.
- Can also use Ctrl+l for this command.
```
clear
```
