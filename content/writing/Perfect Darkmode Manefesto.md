I will stretch for 10-20 Minutes per day and practice good back hygiene and posture throughout the day. I will review back mechanic book once per day. I will also take it easy physically as to not make back pain worse. This will help me fix my back pain and get back to doing the physical hobbies that I love.

I will be more playful when dealing with kids. I will try to remain calm and patient. I will also read playful parenting while I poop. This will help my kids have better self esteem and help me enjoy my kids more. 

I will cuddle wife more. And listen. I will also read a relationship book after I finish the parenting book. This will help with our relationship and help us have a better time together. 

I will stick with testosterone shots until I am off caffeine for 90 days. And can afford to do a proper PCT. For now, stick with 1.6cc every other day.
