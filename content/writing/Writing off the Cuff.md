My favorite and by far easiest method of writing is writing off the cuff. You get your thoughts down and spring new thoughts to life. You are finding out what you know without referencing materials.

You are creating out of nothing. It is pure writing and creativity folded into one. We all have a “Muse” that will give to us whenever we ask.

All you have to do is start writing.

# Writer’s block doesn’t exist.

Writer’s Block sucks. You don’t Know what to write next. You are stuck in limbo. But are you really stuck? You really can’t Think of ANYTHING to put down next?

Writer’s Block is a trick! Perhaps it’s An excuse cropping up to get you out of the zone.

Your thoughts never stop. So start there. What’s The first thing that comes to mind when you read your last sentence?

Just write that down and move on. Follow your train of thought to find out who you really are.

And to find out what you really have to say.

# The first draft is always garbage.

Live it. Accept it. Once you do. It doesn’t matter what you write. Just put down whatever comes to your mind. No matter how bad it seems. You will touch up later.

Writers block doesn’t even exist. It’s Just a concept. You aren’t writing because you can’t think of anything.

It’s because you are a perfectionist. You are unwilling to put down “garbage” on a piece of paper.

# Just keep going…

Don’t Stop. You have set aside this time to create. And creating is what gets your blood flowing. It’s The reason you are alive.

Distractions are going to try and stop you. They are the enemy. And this is how you win.

Stay on the course. The wind is your muse and your sail is your unrelenting determination.

The ocean wants to keep your from going anywhere. It can’t do this if you do not will it.

# The conclusion doesn’t matter.

You have to end your writing. But this is not the end. It is actually a new beginning for your reader. You have given them your best.

Remind them what you said and give them a plan of what is next. You just changed a life forever. No matter how big or small of a change.

This is your impact. This is why you are here.
