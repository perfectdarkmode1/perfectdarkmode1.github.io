No really. Look at this bird:

Any substance that gives you a lift follows the same journey as the bird in the video. 

  

> DISCLAIMER: YOU MAY NOT FEEL ANY NEGATIVES OF CAFFEINE UNTIL YEARS OF USE!!

  

Or.. you may not associate the negatives that are currently happening with caffeine. This is because there is a disconnect with the immediate response to caffeine and the negatives it brings.

  

Here's how it goes:

  

1. You take caffeine through your medium of choice. (Some even go for the suppository... Coffee ENEMAS anyone?)

2. You think, "Caffeine is great". Look at all your new "energy, adrenaline rush, tomato"! 

3. You wake up the next morning. Dreary and weary. Can't get out of bed. Let's get some of that caffeine to make me feel better. 

  

And the cycle repeats. You associate your dreary wearies with getting old. Your lack of sleep is because you just suck at sleeping. Your fits of irritability are just your personality. Your joint pain is your poor posture, not the fact that you no longer have the energy to maintain a good posture, because caffeine is sucking the life out of you. 

  

Take a look at this advertisement from 1924 mentioned in Eugene M. Schwartz's famous book "Breakthrough Advertising":

  

> WHY MEN CRACK.. .

> An authority of international standing recently wrote;

> "You have overeaten and plugged your organs with moderate stimulants, the worst of which are not only alcohol and tobacco, but caffeine and sugar . . . "

There you have it. Not from me but from a professional word smith. People knew this was a problem 100 years ago. Yet, we are all still addicted. 

  

Here's the #1 post on Reddit regarding caffeine:

> ### It's Not Withdrawal. Your Career Just Sucks
> 
>   
> 
> I'm a software developer, about a year and a half caffeine-free. Immediately after quitting, my productivity at work plummeted. It hasn't returned to pre-caffeine levels since.
> 
> I have realized that this is not due to withdrawal, but rather because I cannot, as a human being, sit in front of a screen all day, toiling away at meaningless work for a soulless corporation. Caffeine played a pivotal role in hiding this reality. With caffeine, I can slog through all manner of tedium and even have fun. Without it, I feel a strong attraction to a "stop and smell the roses" mode of living. I go on long walks, look at trees, write poetry, and I don't get _jack shit_ done at work.
> 
> I can breathe. My sleep is perfect. My digestion is perfect. My livelihood, however, is in jeopardy. I just wanted to put this out there, in case anyone has quit caffeine but is struggling with productivity or lack of motivation: It's not withdrawal. You're a spiritual creature in a cold, mechanical system, and now there's no hiding.

  

There is something deeper going on here. Is caffeine used as a form of control? I mean, the Nazi's gave prisoners soup, bread, and coffee for a reason right? 


Tips on getting through withdrawal:

The Insomnia will pass.
