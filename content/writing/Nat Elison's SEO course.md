Leveling up
- Start with an easy keyword
- Over time, adjust article for harder and harder keywords
- Long tail keywords with low competition
- Can change meta title for google to the harder keyword later
- Can only change the meta title unless there is something the content is missing that the broader keyword asks for. 
- At first, pick something under 5,000 searches
