There are austerities you should avoid all together. Such as any poison to the body. (Drugs, alcohol, caffeine, etc.)Â 

There may be drugs or chemicals perscribed by a doctor that are life saving. Choose your doctor wisely.

Other austerities should be used or enjoyed. But periodically given up. Both as a test of suffering, and to open up other doors.
