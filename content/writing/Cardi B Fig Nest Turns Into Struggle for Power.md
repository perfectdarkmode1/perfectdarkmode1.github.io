While my wife and I where doing dishes last night. Three plump figs lay on the counter. Ripe and ready to be devoured. 

I don't want those figs in here! What about the wasps?

There are no wasps in the figs honey.

How do you know? I bet there are wasps in them right now! We are going to wake up with wasps all over the house!

No honey. No wasps. I promise. Maybe waps though. 

Ur stupid.

Movement in one of the figs turned our heads. Small black weave peeks through a newly formed hole. We can't believe our eyes. Now fully out of the fig. We take a closer look. A tiny, 1 cm high Cardi B is standing on the fig. Just twerking. We hear a squeaking noise. It is talking. Or rapping?

"Said my face bomb, ass tight
racks stack up shack height
jewelry on me flashlight
I been lit since last night
Hit him with that good good
Make a n$&&a act right
Broke boys don't deserve no p^\$$y
(I know that's right)"

We are amazed. We run to another room to  grab our phones. When we return to the kitchen. Unbelievable. About 45 more tiny, 1cm Cardi Bs are spread around the figs on the kitchen counter. All twerking. All rapping. 

What is going on? 

I don't know..

We don't know what to do. So we decide to let them live. 

Let's just see how this plays out. 

The Cardi Bs stopped singing after the fourth song. It just sounded like insects when we were far away. When we wake up in the morning. Thinking it was all a strange dream. I head to the kitchen to make my wife a cup of coffee. I see Cardi Bs all over the place. The other figs have hatched. There have to be at least two hundred of them. 

They were no longer singing. They were hungry. Thirsty. 

A few of them found some crumbs to chew on. A water source, the dog bowl, had 5 or 6 Cardi Bs drowned. Others found small puddles of water in the sink. There was tiny poop urine in random places. And worse yet, there were a few that resorted to eating other Cardi Bs. We had to give them proper amenities.  

As we went to clean up, they started talking shit. 

Yo pu\$$y ass bitch

Excuse me?

You heard me

I flicked it. I have zero tolerance for shit talking. 

We set them up a small camp. Tried to use Lego where we could. But the Lego coffee cup was more like a bath tub for them. Over the next few weeks. The Cardi Bs would grow up to two inches tall! They were getting organized. Building. Planning. There were constant fights. They were all the alpha. Which means no one was.
