Writing is the single most important skill you can have in business and in life. We do it every day. Everyone is a writer. You write when you are sending emails. You Write when you are commenting code. You write when you make a grocery list. 

AI is taking over and writing tons of low quality crap on the interwebs. Now is the best time to up your writing game and stand out over the robots. Hone your craft and AI will never be able to compete. 

Reach out to me if you need any help. I LOVE writing blog posts about tech, personal development, and more.
