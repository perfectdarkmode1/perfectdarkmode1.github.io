Any claim you make regarding caffeine is going to be filled with hot takes. For example, I could say that quitting caffeine should, in theory, promote healthy testosterone levels. 

The immediate response from many would be: "There is no scientific evidence for this." or "Actually, here is a study showing caffeine use spikes testosterone levels." 

But when you think of the time frame for most caffeine studies, your looking at around 1 day to no more than a few weeks. But we lack long term studies of people who have given up the bean and moved on to a healthier lifestyle. 

Here would be my general points for this argument:

1. Healthy testosterone levels are a marker for health. The healthier you are, the higher your testosterone levels will be. (Without artificially increasing your levels through drugs or supplements.)

2. Caffeine, lowers your overall health over time.

3. When your body is in fight or flight mode. (Stress hormones go up) The first things to go is sexual function. 

Let's go over each of these points one by one. 

## Healthy testosterone levels are a marker for health. The healthier you are, the higher your testosterone levels will be. 

Think of all of the things that naturally raise your testosterone levels. 

- Exercise.
- Weight loss.
- Correcting vitamin deficiencies. (Selenium and Vitamin d being the most common)
- Getting good sleep. 
- Gaining muscle mass. 
- Quitting alcohol/ drugs. 

These are all things that make you healthier. This point seems pretty obvious so I won't bore you with further analysis. 


## Caffeine, lowers your overall health over time.

DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A SCIENTIST. I RELY MOSTLY ON PURE INTUITION BASED ON MY LIFE EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF 1,000's OF OTHERS.

This one seems obvious as well. You are ingesting a natural insecticide (poison) and central nervous system stimulant. One linked to stomach issues, malnutrition, insomnia, hypertension, high blood pressure, elevated cortisol, etc. 

## When your body is in fight or flight mode. (Stress hormones go up) The first things to go is sexual function. 

Your adrenals are too busy pumping out cortisol and getting worn out over time to produce steroid hormones. (Adrenal insufficiency).
