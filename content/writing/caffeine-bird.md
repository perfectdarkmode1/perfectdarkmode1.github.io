No seriously. Look at this bird.

Any substance that gives you a lift follows the same journey as the bird in the video. You start out at a healthy balance. But before you know it. You are trapped in an addictive cycle.

> DISCLAIMER: YOU MAY NOT FEEL ANY NEGATIVES OF CAFFEINE UNTIL YEARS OF USE!!

Or.. you may not associate the negatives that are currently happening with caffeine. This is because there is a disconnect with the immediate response to caffeine and the negatives it brings.

Here’s how it goes:

1. You take caffeine through your medium of choice. (Some even go for the suppository… Coffee ENEMAS anyone?)
    
2. You think, “Caffeine is great”. Look at all your new “energy, adrenaline rush, tomato!”.
    
3. You wake up the next morning. Dreary and weary. Can’t get out of bed. Let’s get some of that caffeine to make you feel better.
    

And the cycle repeats. You associate your dreary wearies with getting old. Your lack of sleep is because you just suck at sleeping. Your fits of irritability are just your personality.

Your joint pain is your poor posture, not the fact that you no longer have the energy to maintain a good posture, because caffeine is sucking the life out of you.

Take a look at this advertisement from 1924 mentioned in Eugene M. Schwartz’s famous book “Breakthrough Advertising”:

> WHY MEN CRACK.. .

> An authority of international standing recently wrote;

> “You have overeaten and plugged your organs with moderate stimulants, the worst of which are not only alcohol and tobacco, but caffeine and sugar . . . “

> You know them. Strong men. Vigorous men, robust men — men who have never had a sick day in their lives.

> They drive. They drive themselves to the limit. They lash themselves over the limit with stimulants. They crack. Often, they crash.

> You have seen them afterwards. Pitiful shells. The zest gone, the fire gone. Burnt-out furnaces of energy.

> “He was such a healthy-looking man “

> He was. His health was his undoing. His constitution absorbed punishment. Otherwise he might have been warned in time.

> “For every action there is an equal and contrary reaction.” You learned the law in physics. It applies to bodies.

> For every ounce of energy gained by stimulation, by whipping the nerves to action, an ounce of reserve strength is drained . . .  
> But repeated withdrawals exhaust any reserve.

> Physical bankruptcy. Then the crash . . .

> It’s time to get back to normal, to close the drafts, to bank some of the fires…

> Avoid stimulants. What is good for the boy is good for the man . . .

> Borrowed Energy Must Be Repaid!

> Two million American families avoid caffeine by drinking Postum.

> And two million American families are better

> off for it. . .

People knew this was a problem 100 years ago. Yet, we are all still addicted.

# Caffeine is the #1 ignored factor when it comes to health.

Here is the “advice” we see over and over again in regards to taking control of your physical health:

- Cut carbs.
    
- Cut out blue light.
    
- Don’t eat past 6.
    
- Don’t eat uncooked spinach.
    
- Eat only meat.
    
- Stop eating unsoaked almonds.
    
- Take this supplement.
    

80% of Americans consume some form of caffeine daily. I’ve seen mothers give their toddlers Mountain dew! Almonds are the problem? What world are we living in?

We are so obsessed with minor details that we miss the obvious. Seriously, anyone who is recommending putting butter in your coffee for optimal health has no clue what optimal health is.

People are clueless about caffeine. Why?

Because it’s “Normal”.

It’s a problem that is hard to see before it’s too late.

“But caffeine is not a problem for me.”

Any amount of stimulants in your body is a problem. It’s effecting you **today.** If you want to feel breadth of emotions again, have unlimited energy throughout the day, have healthy joints, be able to recover fully from exercise, have the most creative thoughts you can possibly have…

You need to quit caffeine. Plain and simple. You are not living the life you are fully capable of.

# Studies showing caffeine is “Healthy”.

Really think about it. Would you believe studies about cocaine funded by cocaine dealers or done my cocaine addicts that think cocaine gives them a positive lift?

There is a billion dollar industry that thrives off of you believing this nonsense. And the mildness of the drug and normalization make many people never second guess it.

The science is not as bleeding edge as we think. Especially when it comes to nutrition. Caffeine is not a vitamin. We need to start relying a little bit more on human intuition then studies funded by big caffeine and drug addicts.

# Is caffeine stopping us from living the lives we truly want?

Here’s the #1 post on Reddit regarding caffeine:

> It’s Not Withdrawal. Your Career Just Sucks

> I’m a software developer, about a year and a half caffeine-free. Immediately after quitting, my productivity at work plummeted. It hasn’t returned to pre-caffeine levels since.

> I have realized that this is not due to withdrawal, but rather because I cannot, as a human being, sit in front of a screen all day, toiling away at meaningless work for a soulless corporation. Caffeine played a pivotal role in hiding this reality. With caffeine, I can slog through all manner of tedium and even have fun. Without it, I feel a strong attraction to a “stop and smell the roses” mode of living. I go on long walks, look at trees, write poetry, and I don’t get _jack shit_ done at work.

> I can breathe. My sleep is perfect. My digestion is perfect. My livelihood, however, is in jeopardy. I just wanted to put this out there, in case anyone has quit caffeine but is struggling with productivity or lack of motivation: It’s not withdrawal. You’re a spiritual creature in a cold, mechanical system, and now there’s no hiding.

There is something deeper going on here. Is caffeine used as a form of control? I mean, the Nazi’s gave prisoners soup, bread, and coffee for a reason right?

Caffeine is a worker bee drug. It makes you a slave and complacent. It numbs your prefrontal cortex just like any other drug.

This screws with your ability to delay gratification and makes you seek out more short term rewards to numb the pain.

I go over the pain-pleasure balance in my “[Dopamine Nation](https://medium.com/@davidvargasxyz/dopamine-nation-summary-and-review-ee860d628cfc)” summary. So I won’t re-hash it here.

But the pain-pleasure balance is important to understand. Once you do. You will realize that putting anything in your body that is not food or water is making you miserable.

# Caffeine is a gateway drug.

Imagine this..

You are anxious, on edge, irritable, depressed, have trouble sleeping. You think this is just you. You reach for alcohol or weed or Kratom or whatever to take the edge off. You were only in that state because of caffeine.

This scenario may not have happened to you yet. But I guarantee it has happened to millions of people who have turned towards drugs to numb the pain.

Caffeine kills people, tips people with deadly heart disease over the edge, plays a factor in road rage car accident, cause vitamin and mineral deficiencies, cardiac arrhythmia, perpetuates drug addiction, and much more.

It’s poison.

When are we going to wake up?
