### Hey, I'm David. 

I am a tech enthusiast interested in Linux, open source projects, Networking, scripting, programming, and cybersecurity. This is my hub where I will be teaching as I learn. This will help me pick up skills better and hopefully help others along the way.

The site name "Perfect Dark Mode" is a throwback to the game "Perfect Dark" and the best visual theme for any technology, dark mode. Just thought it was a clever play on words and matches some aspiration in me that wants to be a cool stealthy hacker.
