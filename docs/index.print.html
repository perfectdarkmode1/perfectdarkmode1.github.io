<h1 id="boot">Boot</h1>

<h4 id="boot-process-overview">Boot Process Overview</h4>
<p>4 stages</p>
<p>1 BIOS</p>
<ul>
<li>initialize hardware and use POST to check hardware</li>
</ul>
<p>2 Bootloader</p>
<ul>
<li>loads kernel into memory</li>
<li>starts kernel w/ parameters</li>
<li>GRUB is a common bootloader</li>
</ul>
<p>3 Kernel</p>
<ul>
<li>initializes devices and memory</li>
<li>load up the init process</li>
</ul>
<p>4 init</p>
<ul>
<li>starts and stop essential service process on the system</li>
</ul>
<p>3 major implementations of init</p>
<ul>
<li>Boot process: BIOS</li>
</ul>
<p>BIOS</p>
<p>performs integrity checks</p>
<p>main goal: find the system bootloader</p>
<p>boots hard drive &gt; search for boot block &gt; look at MBR or GPT</p>
<p>Majority of Linux uses BIOS</p>
<p>MBR</p>
<p>located in the 1st 512 bytes of 1st sector on HD</p>
<p>contains code to load the program that loads the bootloader</p>
<p>GPT</p>
<p>Intended for use with EFI</p>
<p>UEFI &gt; succesor to BIOS</p>
<p>1st sector is reserved for a “protective MBR”</p>
<p>Makes it possible to boot to a BIOS-based machine</p>
<p>UEFI</p>
<p>stores startup info in a .efi file</p>
<p>.efi is stored on EFI system partition on the hardware</p>
<p>EFI system partition</p>
<p>- contains boot loader</p>
<p>Boot process: Bootloader</p>
<p>responsible for:</p>
<p>- booting into an OS</p>
<p>- selecting kernel to use</p>
<p>- Specify Kernel Parameters</p>
<p>- GRUB, LILO, efilinux, coreboot, SYSLINUX</p>
<p>View kernel parameters</p>
<p>enter GRUB menu on startup using ‘e’ key</p>
<p>- initrd - Location of initial RAM disk</p>
<p>- BOOT_IMAGE - location of kernel image</p>
<p>- root - root filesystem location</p>
<p>kernel is often represented here by UUID or device name such as /dev/sda1</p>
<p>- ro - mounts the filesystem as read-only</p>
<p>Boot Process: Kernel</p>
<p>initd vs initramfs</p>
<p>Initrd (initial RAM disk)</p>
<p>- was used as a temporary root folder to get bootup drivers</p>
<p>Initramfs</p>
<p>- Temporary root filesystem built into the kernel to load drivers for root filesystem</p>
<p>Mounting the root filesystem</p>
<p>- Creates the root device and mounts thge root partition</p>
<p>- Root partition is first mounted in read-only mode</p>
<p>- so fsck can safely check system integrity</p>
<p>- Then root system is mounted in read-write mode</p>
<p>- Kernel then locates init program and executes it</p>
<p>Boot Process: Init</p>
<p>3 implementations of init</p>
<p>1. System V init (sysv)</p>
<p>- traditional version</p>
<p>- Sequencially starts and stops processes based on startup scripts</p>
<p>- state of machine is denoted by run levels</p>
<p>- Each run level starts/stops machine in a different way</p>
<p>2. Upstart</p>
<p>- found on older Ubuntu installations</p>
<p>3. Syst</p>
<p>- new standard for init</p>
<p>- goal oriented</p>
<p>- attempts to satisfy goal&rsquo;s dependencies</p>

<h1 id="command-line">Command Line</h1>

<p>The Shell</p>
<p>A program that takes your commands from the keyboard and sends them to the operating system to perform.</p>
<p>Almost all Linux distros will default to the bash shell.</p>
<p>Shell prompt , for the most part, adheres to the following format</p>
<p>username@hostname:current_directory</p>
<p>david@David-Thomas:/$</p>
<p>The $ is for a normal user using bash</p>
<p>Some commands: (Case sensitive)</p>
<p>$ echo</p>
<p>Echo Hello World</p>
<p>Output: Hello World</p>
<p>$ date</p>
<p>Output: Mon Nov 30 09:57:25 MST 2020</p>
<p>$ whoami</p>
<p>Output: username</p>
<p>pwd (Print Working Directory)</p>
<p>Everything in linux is a file, all files are organized in a hierarchical directory tree. The first directory in the file system is the root directory</p>
<p>$pwd</p>
<p>Output: current directory</p>
<p>cd (Change Directory)</p>
<p>2 different ways to specify a path</p>
<p>Absolute Path: starts from / (root) directory</p>
<p>Relative path: from where you currently are /pictures etc.</p>
<p>$ cd /home/david/pictures</p>
<p>Output: changes to the above directory</p>
<p>$ cd Hawaii</p>
<p>(ran from directory above)</p>
<p>Output: goes to Hawaii folder in the above directory</p>
<p>$ cd .</p>
<p>(current directory)</p>
<p>$ cd ..</p>
<p>(parent directory)</p>
<p>$ cd ~</p>
<p>(home directory)</p>
<p>$ cd -</p>
<p>(previous directory)</p>
<p>ls (List Directories)</p>
<p>Lists directory contents of the current directory by default but you can specify which path you want to list the directories of.</p>
<p>$ ls</p>
<p>$ ls /home/david</p>
<p>ls also shows detailed information about the files and directories you are looking at.</p>
<p>Not all files in a directory will be visible. Filenames that start with . are hidden, you can view them with ls -a (a is for all)</p>
<p>-l flag will list files in long format (ls -l)</p>
<p>the output starting from the left shows file permissions, number of links, owner name, owner group, file size, timestamp of last modification, and file/ directory name.</p>
<p>$ ls -R</p>
<p>recursively list directory contents</p>
<p>$ ls - r</p>
<p>reverse order while sorting</p>
<p>$ ls -t</p>
<p>sort by modification time, newest first</p>
<p>$ ls -la</p>
<p>uses -l and -a flags together. Use this format to combine flags, the order doesn&rsquo;t usually matter but the flags are ran left to right in order.</p>
<p>Touch (allows you to create new empty files)</p>
<p>$touch mynewfile</p>
<p>creates a file called mynewfile</p>
<p>if you touch an existing file then it will update the timestamp on that file.</p>
<p>file</p>
<p>$file banana.jpg</p>
<p>will show a description of the file&rsquo;s contents.</p>
<p>banana.jpg: empty</p>
<p>mynewfile: ASCII text</p>
<p>cat (concatenate)</p>
<p>$ cat mynewfile</p>
<p>Output: hello</p>
<p>You can also cat multiple files</p>
<p>$cat mynewfile banana.jpg</p>
<p>Output: hello</p>
<p>This only says hello because banana.jpg is empty.</p>
<p>less</p>
<p>opens a page file of a file that you choose</p>
<p>$less scribble.txt</p>
<p>or $less \home\david\scribble.txt</p>
<p>in the page viewer there are commands to help you navigate.</p>
<p>q - quit out of less</p>
<p>page up, page down, up and down - navigate using page and arrow keys</p>
<p>g - moves to the beginning of the text file</p>
<p>G - Moves to the end of a text file</p>
<p>/search - search for words in the document. Prefacing words you want to search with /</p>
<p>h - help with using less</p>
<p>history</p>
<p>$ history - shows previously used commands</p>
<p>$ !! - runs the last used commands</p>
<p>ctrl-R - reverse search command, start typing the command you want and use ctrl-r to cycle through previous commands based on your search. hit enter once you have found the command you want.</p>
<p>$ clear - clears command prompt to a fresh one.</p>
<p>the history is not cleared though.</p>
<p>tab completion - use tab to auto complete a command.</p>
<p>cp (Copy)</p>
<p>makes a copy of files</p>
<p>$ cp mycoolfile /home/pete/Documents/cooldocs</p>
<p>copies mycoolfile to /home/pete/Documents/cooldocs</p>
<p>$ cp *.jpg /home/pete/Pictures</p>
<p>copies all files with .jpg extension to /home/pete/Pictures</p>
<p>$ cp -r Pumpkin/ /home/peteDocuments</p>
<p>if you copy a file over to a directory that has the same filename, the file will be overwritten with whatever you are copying over. You can use the -i flag to prompt you before overwriting a file.</p>
<p>mv (move)</p>
<p>Used for moving files and renaming them</p>
<p>Similar to cp command in terms of flags and functionality.</p>
<p>You can rename files like this:</p>
<p>$ mv oldfile newfile</p>
<p>move file to a different directory</p>
<p>$ mv file2 /home/david/Documents</p>
<p>move multiple files</p>
<p>$ mv file1 file 2 /somedirectory</p>
<p>rename a directory</p>
<p>$ mv directory1 directory2</p>
<p>if you mv a file or directory  it will overwrite anything in the same directory. You can use -I flag to prompt you before overwriting anything</p>
<p>$ mv -i directory1 directory2</p>
<p>to mv a file to overwrite a previous one and back up the old one use -b. It will rename the old one with a ~.</p>
<p>$ mv -b directory1 directory2</p>
<p>mkdir (make directory)</p>
<p>Will create a directory if it doesn&rsquo;t already exist.</p>
<p>$ mkdir books paintings</p>
<p>Makes multiple directories at the same time</p>
<p>$mkdir -p books/hemmingway/favorites</p>
<p>makes subdirectories with -p (parent flag)</p>
<p>rm (Remove)</p>
<p>used to delete files and directories</p>
<p>$ rm file1</p>
<p>Once files are removed they are gone for good.</p>
<p>Write-protected files will prompt you before deleting them. If a directory is write-protected it will also not easily be removed.</p>
<p>$ rm -f file1</p>
<p>-f flag forces rm to remove all files whether they are write-protected or not, without prompting the user (as long as you have the appropriate permissions.</p>
<p>$ rm -i file</p>
<p>-i flag will prompt you on whether or not you actually want to remove the file.</p>
<p>$ rm -r directory</p>
<p>(recursive) You can&rsquo;t remove a directory by default. You must use the -r flag. this will remove all files and subdirectories within a directory.</p>
<p>$ ir directory</p>
<p>You can delete an empty directory this way.</p>
<p>find</p>
<p>$ find /home -name puppies.jpg</p>
<p>Specify the directory you are searching, what you are searching for. This will search subdirectories as will.</p>
<p>$ find /home -type d -name MyFolder</p>
<p>This is trying to find type d (directory)</p>
<p>help</p>
<p>Used to help you with a command or check what flags are available.</p>
<p>$ help echo</p>
<p>Gives a description and options for the Echo command This format is for built in bash commands.</p>
<p>$ echo &ndash;help</p>
<p>Conventional standard if the above option does not work. Used for dev tools.</p>
<p>man (manual)</p>
<p>$ man ls</p>
<p>Manuals built in to most Linux operating systems. They provide documentation about commands and other aspects of the system.</p>
<p>whatis</p>
<p>Provides a brief description on what a command does.</p>
<p>$ whatis cat</p>
<p>Sourced from cat&rsquo;s manual page.</p>
<p>alias</p>
<p>Uses an alias for longer or frequently used commands.</p>
<p>$ alias foobar =&lsquo;ls -la&rsquo;</p>
<p>now you can just type foobar instead of typing ls -la</p>
<p>~/.bashrc</p>
<p>./profile in Windows Subsystem Linux</p>
<p>to add a permanent alias</p>
<p>$ unalias foobar</p>
<p>removes an alias</p>
<p>exit</p>
<p>$ exit</p>
<p>exits from the shell (completely closes the window.)</p>
<p>$ logout</p>

<h1 id="devices">Devices</h1>

<p>/dev directory</p>
<p>You can interact with device drivers through device files  or device nodes, these are special files that look like regular files. You can use ls,cat, etc to interact with them. Generally stored in /dev directory</p>
<p>$ ls /dev</p>
<p>When you send output to /dev/null, the kernal knows that this device takes all of our input and just discards it, so nothing gets returned.</p>
<p>Device Types</p>
<p>$ ls -l /dev</p>
<p>brw-rw&mdash;-  1 root disk  8,  0 Dec 20 20:13 sda</p>
<p>crw-rw-rw-  1 root root  1,  3 Dec 20 20:13 null</p>
<p>srw-rw-rw-  1 root root  0 Dec 20 20:13 log</p>
<p>prw-r&ndash;r&ndash;  1 root root  0 Dec 20 20:13 fdata</p>
<p>The columns are as follows from left to right:</p>
<p>Permissions</p>
<p>Owner</p>
<p>Group</p>
<p>Major Device Number</p>
<p>Minor Device Number</p>
<p>Timestamp</p>
<p>Device Name</p>
<p>Device files are denoted as the following:</p>
<p>c - character</p>
<p>b - block</p>
<p>p - pipe</p>
<p>s - socket</p>
<p>Character Device</p>
<p>These devices transfer data one character at a time. You&rsquo;ll see a lot of pseudo devices (/dev/null) as character devices, these devices aren&rsquo;t really physically connected to a machine, but they allow the operating system greater functionality.</p>
<p>Block Device</p>
<p>These devices transfer data in large fixed-sized blocks. You&rsquo;ll most commonly see devices that utilize data blocks as block devices, such as harddrives, filesystems, etc.</p>
<p>Pipe Device</p>
<p>Named pipes allow two or more processes to communicate with each other, these are similar to character devices, but instead of having output sent to a device, it&rsquo;s sent to another process.</p>
<p>Socket Device</p>
<p>Socket devices facilitate communication between processes, similar to pipe devices but they can communicate with many processes at once.</p>
<p>Device Characterization</p>
<p>Devices are characterized using two numbers, major device number and minor device number.</p>
<p>The major device number represents the device driver that is used. The minor number tells the kernal which unique device it is in this driver class.</p>
<p>Device Names</p>
<p>SCSI Devices</p>
<p>Protocol used to allow communication between disks, printers, scanners, and other peripherals to your system. Linux systems correspond SCSI disks with hard disk drives in /dev. They are represented by a prefix of sd (SCSI disk)</p>
<p>Common SCSI device files</p>
<p>- /dev/sda - first hard disk</p>
<p>- /dev/sdb - Second hard disk</p>
<p>- /dev/sda3 - Third partition on the first hard disk</p>
<p>Pseudo Devices</p>
<p>Pseudo devices aren&rsquo;t really connected to your system. Most common pseudo devices are character devices.</p>
<p>- /dev/zero - accepts and discards all input, produces a continuous stream of NULL (zero value) bytes.</p>
<p>- /dev/null - accepts and discards all input, produces no output</p>
<p>- /dev/random - produces random numbers</p>
<p>PATA Devices</p>
<p>Sometimes in older systems you may see hard drives being referred to with an hd prefix</p>
<p>/dev/hda - First hard disk</p>
<p>/dev/hdd2 - Second partition on 4th hard disk</p>
<p>sysfs</p>
<p>A virtual filesystem, most often mounted to the /sys directory. It gives us more detailed information than what we would be able to see in the /dev directory.</p>
<p>The /dev directory is simple, it allows other programs to access devices themselves. The /sys filesystem is used to view information and manage the device.</p>
<p>/sys filesystem contains all  the information for all devices on your system, such as the manufacturer, model, where the device is plugged in, the state of the device, the hierarchy of devices, and more.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really interact with devices here, you just manage them.</p>
<p>udev</p>
<p>Dynamically creates and removes device files depending on whether or not they are connected. There is a udev daemon that is running on the system and it listens for messages from the kernel about devices connected to the system. Udevd will parse that information and it will match the data with the rules that are specified in /etc/udev/rules.d. Depending on those rules it will most likely created device nodes and symbolic links for the devices. You can write your own udev rules. But comes with it&rsquo;s on rules by default.</p>
<p>$ udevadm info &ndash;query=all &ndash;name=/dev/sda</p>
<p>To view the udev database and sysfs</p>
<p>lsusb, lspci, lssci</p>
<p>$ lsusb</p>
<p>List USB devices</p>
<p>$ lspci</p>
<p>List PCI devices</p>
<p>$ lsscsi</p>
<p>List scsi devices</p>
<p>dd</p>
<p>Useful tool for converting and copying data. It reads input from a file or data stream and writes it to a file or data stream.</p>
<p>$ dd if=/home/pete/backup.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1024</p>
<p>This command is copying the contents of backup.img to/dev/sdb. It will copy the data in blocks of 1024 bytes until there is no more data to be copied.</p>
<p>- if=file - input file, read from a file instead of standard input</p>
<p>- of=file - Output file, write to a file instead of standard output</p>
<p>- bs=bytes - Block size, it reads and writes this many bytes of data at a time. You can use different size metrics by denoting the size with a K for kilobyte, m for megabyte, etc, so 1024 bytes is 1k.</p>
<p>- count=number - number of blocks to copy.</p>
<p>Some dd commands use the count option.</p>
<p>You can use dd to backup whole disk drives, restoring disk images and more.</p>

<p>File permissions</p>
<p>$ls -l Desktop/</p>
<p>drwxr-xr-x 2 pete penguins 4096 Dec 1 11:45 .</p>
<p>Four parts to file permissions</p>
<p>Filetype (d (for directory) in the example) a is for regular file</p>
<p>These 3 parts are the actual file permissions.</p>
<p>d | rwx | r-x | r-x</p>
<p>Filetype | User Permissions | Group Permissions | Other Permissions</p>
<p>r - readable</p>
<p>w - writable</p>
<p>x - executable</p>
<ul>
<li>empty</li>
</ul>
<p>Modifying Permissions</p>
<p>$ chmod u+x myfile</p>
<p>Format: Chmod, permission set (user, group or other), file</p>
<p>The + is adding the permission</p>
<p>$ chmod u-x myfile</p>
<p>The - is removing the permission</p>
<p>$ chmod ug+w</p>
<p>Adding write to user and group (add &ldquo;o&rdquo; for other permissions)</p>
<p>Numerical representations for changing permissions</p>
<p>4: read permission</p>
<p>2: write permission</p>
<p>1: execute permission</p>
<p>Ex: $ chmod 755 myfile</p>
<p>Rwx re re user, group, other</p>
<p>Ownership permissions</p>
<p>$ sudo chown patty myfile</p>
<p>Sets the owner of myfile to patty (chown is change owner)</p>
<p>$ sudo chgrp whales myfile</p>
<p>Set the group of myfile to whales (chgrp = change group)</p>
<p>$ sudo chown patty:whales myfile</p>
<p>Changes group and user at the same time.</p>
<p>Umask</p>
<p>Used to chane default permissions</p>
<p>Only persists if you modify .profile</p>
<p>$ umask 021</p>
<p>Takes away x permissions from others (the default is 022)</p>
<p>Setuid</p>
<p>SUID</p>
<p>Allows a user to run a program as the owner of the program file rather than as themselves.</p>
<p>in /usr/bin/passwd you&rsquo;ll see an &rsquo;s&rsquo; in permissions for SUID.</p>
<p>This means when a user is running the passwd command they are running as root.</p>
<p>-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 47032 Dec 1 11:45 /usr/bin/passwd</p>
<p>Modifying SUID</p>
<p>2 ways to modify</p>
<p>Symbolic:</p>
<p>$ sudo chmod u+s myfile</p>
<p>Numerical:</p>
<p>$ sudo chmod 4755 myfile</p>
<p>SUID  is denoted with a 4 and is pre-pended to the permission set.</p>
<p>SUID denoted as a capital S does not have execute permissions</p>
<p>Setgid</p>
<p>SGID</p>
<p>Allows a program to run as if it was a member of that group.</p>
<p>Modifying SGID</p>
<p>$ sudo chmod g+s myfile</p>
<p>$ sudo chmod 2555 myfile</p>
<p>Numerical representations for SGID is 2</p>
<p>Process permissions</p>
<p>Effective user ID</p>
<p>There are three UIDs associated with every process.</p>
<p>When you launch a process, it runs with the same permissions as the user or group that ran it.  This is used to grant access rights to a process.</p>
<p>Real User ID</p>
<p>The ID of the user who launched the process. Used to track down the user who launched a process.</p>
<p>Saved user ID</p>
<p>Allows a process to switch between the effective user ID and the Real user ID</p>
<p>The Sticky Bit</p>
<p>A permission bit that makes it so only the owner  or root can delete or modify the file.</p>
<p>$ls -ld /tmp</p>
<p>drwxrwxrwxt 6 root root 4096 Dec 15 11:45 /tmp</p>
<p>The t at the end is the sticky bit.</p>
<p>Modify sticky bit</p>
<p>$ sudo chmod +t mydir</p>
<p>$ sudo chmod 1755 mydir</p>
<p>The numerical representation of the sticky bit is 1</p>

<h1 id="general-linux-and-history">General Linux and History</h1>

<p>Richard Stallman started working on the GNU (GNU is Not UNIX) project, the GNU kernel called Hurd, which unfortunately never came to completion. The GNU General Public License (GPL), a free software license, was also created as a result of this.</p>
<p>The Kernel allows hardware to talk to software.</p>
<p>A Linux system is divided into 3 main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware - This includes all the hardware that your system runs on as well as memory, CPU, disks, etc.</li>
<li>Linux Kernel - As we discussed above, the kernel is the core of the operating system. It manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with the system.</li>
<li>User Space - This is where users like yourself will be directly interacting with the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Debian</p>
<p>Composed Entirely of free and open-source software.</p>
<p>3 branches</p>
<ul>
<li>Stable</li>
<li>Testing (rolling)</li>
<li>Unstable (rolling)</li>
</ul>
<p>rolling: any incremental changes will eventually become stable. Wont have to do a full OS install to get next OS release.</p>

<h1 id="init">Init</h1>

<p>System V Overview (sys v) (&ldquo;system five&rdquo;)</p>
<p>- init stops and starts essential processes</p>
<p>- 3 major versions of init</p>
<p>1. system V (most traditional version)</p>
<p>2. upstart</p>
<p>3. syst</p>
<p>- Starts and stops processes sequentially</p>
<p>- uses scripts to start and stop processes</p>
<p>- Easy to solve dependencies (A comes before B)</p>
<p>- Con: Only one service stops or starts at a time.</p>
<p>- State of the machine is defined by runlevels (0-6) (varies by distro)</p>
<p>0: Shutdown</p>
<p>1: Single User Mode</p>
<p>2: multiuser mode without networking</p>
<p>3: multiuser mode with networking</p>
<p>4: unused</p>
<p>5: multiuser mode w/ networking and GUI</p>
<p>6: Reboot</p>
<p>- systems boots and runs scripts associated with runlevel</p>
<p>- scripts locations:</p>
<p>/etc/rc.d/rc[runlevel number].d/</p>
<p>/etc/init.d</p>
<p>- Scripts that start with S(start) or K(kill) will run on startup and shutdown</p>
<p>- numbers next to s or k are the sequence they run in</p>
<p>/etc/rc.d/rc0.d $ ls</p>
<p>k10 updates K80openvpn</p>
<p>- See what runlevel your machine is booting to</p>
<p>/etc.inittab</p>
<p>- You can change default runlevel</p>
<p>- slowly getting replaced</p>
<p>- runlevels exsist in other distros to support systemv scripts</p>
<p>System V Service</p>
<p>Command tools to manage sysv services (not specific to sysv)</p>
<p>List services</p>
<p>$ service &ndash;status-all</p>
<p>Start a service</p>
<p>$ sudo service networking start</p>
<p>Stop a service</p>
<p>$ sudo service networking stop</p>
<p>Restart a service</p>
<p>$ sudo service networking restart</p>
<p>Upstart</p>
<p>developed by canonical (Ubuntu) but Ubuntu uses syst now.</p>
<p>- Event and job driven model</p>
<p>- improves on sysv (strict startup processes/ blocking of tasks.</p>
<p>- To see if your system uses Upstart</p>
<p>/usr/share/upstart (exists)</p>
<p>- Jobs = actions that upstart performs</p>
<p>- Events = messages that are received from other processes to trigger jobs</p>
<p>$ ls /etc/init</p>
<p>- see a list of jobs and their configurations</p>
<p>- Shows how and when to start jobs</p>
<p>- How upstart works</p>
<p>- Loads job config files from /etc/init</p>
<p>- when startup event occurs, run jobs triggered by it</p>
<p>- those jobs make new events and those events trigger more jobs</p>
<p>- Does this until all jobs are complete</p>
<p>Upstart Jobs</p>
<p>- no easy way to see where an event or job originated</p>
<p>- will have to look around in /etc/iniit</p>
<p>View Jobs</p>
<p>$ initctl list</p>
<p>- show jobs and their status</p>
<p>- format: job goal/status</p>
<p>- Will change as jobs start/ stop</p>
<p>View specific jobs</p>
<p>$ initctl status networking</p>
<p>Manually start a job</p>
<p>$ sudo initctl start networking</p>
<p>Manually stop a job</p>
<p>$ sudo initctl stop networking</p>
<p>Manually restart a job</p>
<p>$ sudo initctl restart networking</p>
<p>Manually emit an event</p>
<p>$ sudo initctl omit some_event</p>
<p>Syst</p>
<p>- Emerging standard for init</p>
<p>- To tell if your system uses syst</p>
<p>/use/lib/syst (exists)</p>
<p>- Uses goals to get system up and running</p>
<p>- targets to acheive with dependancies needed for those targets</p>
<p>- does not follow strict sequence</p>
<p>How syst boots</p>
<p>1. loads config files located in /etc/syst/ system or /usr/lib/syst/system</p>
<p>2. Determines boot goal (usually default.target)</p>
<p>3. Finds out dependencies of boot target and activates them</p>
<p>- boots into different targets (like run levels)</p>
<p>poweroff.target</p>
<p>-shutdown</p>
<p>rescue.target</p>
<p>-single user mode</p>
<p>multi-user.target</p>
<p>-multiuser with networking</p>
<p>graphical.target</p>
<p>-multiuser with networking and GUI</p>
<p>reboot.target</p>
<p>-restart</p>
<p>default.target</p>
<p>- usually points to graphical.target</p>
<p>Units</p>
<p>- the main object for syst</p>
<p>- can also mount filesystems, monitor network sockets, etc.</p>
<p>different types of units</p>
<p>Service Units</p>
<p>- end in .service</p>
<p>- The ones that are starting and stopping</p>
<p>Mount Units</p>
<p>- Mount filesystems</p>
<p>- end in .mount</p>
<p>Target units</p>
<p>- group together other units (which all get activated)</p>
<p>- end in .target</p>

<p>$ sudo systemctl.restart networking.service</p>
<p>Enable a unit</p>
<p>$ sudo systemctl enable networking.service</p>
<p>Disable a unit</p>
<p>$ sudo systemctl disable networking.service</p>
<p>Power States</p>
<p>Shutdown system</p>
<p>$ sudo shutdown -h now</p>
<p>- power off</p>
<p>Shutdown and specify the time</p>
<p>$ sudo shutdown -n +2</p>

<h1 id="linux-kernel">Linux Kernel</h1>

<p>Overview</p>
<p>Linux systems can be organized into 3 levels of abstraction</p>
<p>1 Hardware (physical Layer)</p>
<p>Memory, Hard disks, networking, parts, etc.</p>
<p>2 Kernel (Kernel Mode)</p>
<p>- Process and memory management, device communication, system calls, sets up filesystem,etc.</p>
<p>- Talks to hardware to make sure ut does what processes need it to do</p>
<p>3 User Space</p>
<p>- Shell, Programs that you run, graphics, etc.</p>
<p>Privilege Levels (protection rings)</p>
<p>Kernel Mode (ring 0)</p>
<p>- complete access to hardware/ controls everything</p>
<p>User Mode (ring 3)</p>
<p>- small amount of safe memory &amp; CPU that user has access to</p>
<p>System calls</p>
<p>allow ring 3 to access ring 0 temporarily</p>
<p>System calls</p>
<p>- Lets user space processes request an action from the kernel</p>
<p>- Allow us to read/ write a file, modify memory usage, and modify network</p>
<p>- Code inside a program contains a system wrapper</p>
<p>- Trap gets caught by the system call handler and references system call in the system call table</p>
<p>stat() system call</p>
<p>- identified by syscall ID</p>
<p>- Query the states of a file</p>
<p>- After first switching to kernel mode, it finds your syscall # in the syscall ID table then executes the function you ran</p>
<p>- Then returns to user mode</p>
<p>- Process receives return status (success or error)</p>
<p>View syscalls that a process makes</p>
<p>$ strace ls</p>
<p>-useful for debugging</p>
<p>Kernel Installation</p>
<p>Installing and modifying kernels</p>
<p>- multiple kernels can be installed</p>
<p>- choose which one to boot to in GRUB</p>
<p>View Kernel version</p>
<p>$ uname -r</p>
<p>Print system info</p>
<p>$ uname</p>
<p>Ways to install the kernel</p>
<p>- Package manager</p>
<p>$ sudo apt install linux-generic-lts-vivid</p>
<p>- then reboot into new kernel</p>
<p>- You can specify version #</p>
<p>- other packages will need to be installed</p>
<p>- linux headers, linux-image-generic, etc.</p>
<p>Update kernel version</p>
<p>$ sudo apt dist-upgrade</p>
<p>- Upgrades all packages</p>
<p>Kernel Location</p>
<p>- New files are added to the /boot directory when new kernel is installed</p>
<p>/boot</p>
<p>vmlinuz</p>
<p>- the linux kernel</p>
<p>initrd</p>
<p>system.map</p>
<p>- lookup table</p>
<p>config</p>
<p>- kernel config settings</p>
<p>- You can see which modules are loaded if you install by compiling</p>
<p>- Can delete old versions if directory runs out of space (be careful!)</p>
<p>Kernel Modules</p>
<p>- Kernel is a monolithic peice of software</p>
<p>Kernel Modules</p>
<p>- Peices of code that can be loaded/ unloaded into the kernel on demand</p>
<p>- extend functionality of the kernel without adding to core kernel code</p>
<p>- Can usually add Kernel modules without rebooting</p>
<p>View Currently loaded modules</p>
<p>$ lsmod</p>
<p>Load a module</p>
<p>$ sudo modprobe bluetooth</p>
<p>- modprobe tries to load module from /lib/modules/(kernel version)/kernel/drivers</p>
<p>- Modules may also have dependencies that modprobe will load if needed.</p>
<p>Remove a module</p>
<p>$ sudo modprobe -r bluetooth</p>
<p>Load on bootup</p>
<p>Modify the /etc/modprobe.d directory and add a configuration profile</p>
<p>$ /etc/modprobe.d/peanutbutter.conf</p>
<p>Options: peanut_butter = module</p>
<p>type: almond = Kernel Parameter</p>
<p>Do not load on bootup</p>
<p>add this config file</p>
<p>$ /etc/modprobe.d/peanutbutter.conf</p>
<p>Blacklist peanut_butter</p>

<h1 id="packages-and-their-management">Packages and Their Management</h1>

<p>Software Distribution</p>
<p>Packages such as internet browsers, text editors, media players, etc. are  managed via package managers that install and maintain the software on the system. Packages can be installed using sources code instead of by a package manager.</p>
<p>Packages are really just lot and lots of files compiled into one.</p>
<p>The people who write them are called upstream providers. They send updates to package maintainers who get the software into the hands of the users. Package maintainers review, manage, and distribute this software in the form of packages.</p>
<p>Packages Repositories</p>
<p>Central storage location for packages. Machine doesn&rsquo;t know where to look for repositories on the internet unless you tell them.</p>
<p>Pre-approved sources for repositories are located in /etc/apt/sources.list</p>
<p>tar and gzip</p>
<p>Compressing files with gzip</p>
<p>end in a .gz extension</p>
<p>$ gzip mycoolfile - compresses the file</p>
<p>$ gunzip mycoolfile.gz - decompresses the file</p>
<p>Creating archives with tar</p>
<p>Used for multiple files.</p>
<p>will have a .tar extension</p>
<p>$ tar cvf mytarfile.tar mycoolfile1 mycoolfile2 - compresses 2 files.</p>
<p>c - create</p>
<p>v - tell the program to be verbose and let us see what it&rsquo;s doing</p>
<p>f - the filename of the tar file has to come after this option, if you are creating a tar file you&rsquo;ll have to come up with a name.</p>
<p>Unpacking archives with tar</p>
<p>$ tar xvf mytarfile.tar - extracts the file</p>
<p>x - extract</p>
<p>v - tell the program to be verbose and let us see what it&rsquo;s doing.</p>
<p>f - the file you want to extract</p>
<p>Compressing/ uncompressing archives with tar and gzip</p>
<p>Used if a file has a .tar.gz extension.</p>
<p>You can do them one at a time from the end ext first or use z option with tar.</p>
<p>$ tar czf myfile.tar.gz - Create a compressed tar file</p>
<p>$ tar xzf file.tar - uncompress and unpack</p>
<p>eXtract all Zee Files (xzf)</p>
<p>* other compression utilities will require different commands.</p>
<p>Package dependencies</p>
<p>Packages don&rsquo;t usually work alone. They need dependencies to help them run. Packages run code from other libraries so they don&rsquo;t have to have all of the code themselves.</p>
<p>If the dependencies cannot be accessed or they are broke then the package will not run.</p>
<p>rpm and dpkg</p>
<p>.deb (on Debian) and .rpm (on red hat) are executable files just like .exe.</p>
<p>To install these packages use rpm and dpkg (package management commands used to install package files)</p>
<p>These will not install package dependencies.</p>
<p>Install a package</p>
<p>Debian: $ dpkg -i some_deb_package.deb</p>
<p>RPM: $ rpm -i some_rpm_package.rpm</p>
<p>The i stands for install</p>
<p>Remove a package</p>
<p>Debian: $ dpkg -r some_deb_package.deb</p>
<p>RPM: $ rpm - e some_rpm_ package.rpm</p>
<p>Debian: r for remove</p>
<p>RPM: e for erase</p>
<p>List installed packages</p>
<p>Debian: $ dpkg -l</p>
<p>RPM: $ rpm -qa</p>
<p>Debian: l for list</p>
<p>RPM: q for query and a for all</p>
<p>yum and apt</p>
<p>Used for easy package installation, removal, and changes. Can also install package dependencies. Yum is exclusive to the red hat family and apt is exclusive to the Debian family.</p>
<p>Install a package from a repository</p>
<p>Debian: $ apt install package_name</p>
<p>RPM: $ yum install package_name</p>
<p>Remove a package</p>
<p>Debian: $ apt remove package_name</p>
<p>RPM: $ yum erase package_name</p>
<p>Updating packages for a repository</p>
<p>You should update your package repositories so they are up to date before you install and update a package.</p>
<p>Debian: apt update; apt upgrade</p>
<p>RPM: yum update</p>
<p>Get information about an installed package</p>
<p>Debian: apt show package_name</p>
<p>RPM: yum info package_name</p>
<p>Compile source code</p>
<p>Software to install tools that will allow you to compile source code.</p>
<p>$ sudo apt install build-essential</p>
<p>Extract the contents of the package file (most likely a .tar.gz file)</p>
<p>$ tar -xzvf package.tar.gz</p>
<p>Inside the package contents will be a configure script, this script checks for dependencies on your system and if you are missing anything, you&rsquo;ll see an error and you&rsquo;ll need to fix those dependencies.</p>
<p>$ ./configure</p>
<p>The ./ allows you to execute a script in the current directory.</p>
<p>$ make</p>
<p>Inside of the package contents is a file called Makefile that contains rules to building the software. The make command looks at this file to build the software.</p>
<p>$ sudo make install</p>
<p>This command actually installs the package, it will copy the correct files to the correct locations on your computer.</p>
<p>$ sudo make uninstall</p>
<p>To uninstall the package.</p>
<p>Use the checkinstall file instead of the make command. It can be hard to uninstall packages installed with the make command.</p>
<p>$ sudo checkinstall</p>
<p>This will essentially &ldquo;make install&rdquo; and build a .deb package and install it. It makes it easier to remove the package later on.</p>

<h1 id="processes">Processes</h1>

<p>Ps (Processes)</p>
<p>Processes are the programs that are running on your machine. The are managed by the kernel.</p>
<p>PID</p>
<p>ID associated with each process. Assigned in the order that the processes are created.</p>
<p>$ ps - shows a list of running processes.</p>
<p>PID: Process ID</p>
<p>TTY: Controlling terminal associated with the process</p>
<p>STAT: Process status code</p>
<p>TIME: Total CPU usage time</p>
<p>CMD: Name of executable/ command</p>
<p>$ ps aux</p>
<p>a - displays all processes running - even by other users</p>
<p>u - shows more details</p>
<p>x - lists all processes that don&rsquo;t have a TTY associated with it.</p>
<p>shows a ? in the TTY field</p>
<p>common in daemon processes that launch as part of system startup.</p>
<p>USER: The effective user.</p>
<p>PID: Process ID</p>
<p>%CPU: CPU time used divided by the time the process has been running.</p>
<p>%MEM: Ratio of the process&rsquo;s resident set size to the physical memory on the machine.</p>
<p>VSZ: Virtual memory usage of the entire process</p>
<p>RSS: Resident set size, the non-swapped physical memory that a task has used.</p>
<p>TTY: Controlling terminal associated with the process.</p>
<p>STAT: Process status code</p>
<p>START: Start time of the process</p>
<p>TIME: Total CPU usage time</p>
<p>COMMAND: Name of executable/command</p>
<p>$ top</p>
<p>shows real time process info. Refreshes every 10 seconds</p>
<p>Controlling terminal</p>
<p>TTY is the terminal that executed the command</p>
<p>There are two types of terminals</p>
<p>terminal devices</p>
<p>native terminal device that you can type into and send output to your system.</p>
<p>TTY1</p>
<p>enter Ctrl-Alt-F1 to enter</p>
<p>Ctrl-Alt-F7 to exit</p>
<p>pseudoterminal devices</p>
<p>The shell you normally use denoted by PTS under the TTY field</p>
<p>? under the TTY field means that the process is not linked to a controlling terminal.</p>
<p>Process Details</p>
<p>The kernel knows:</p>
<p>The status of the process</p>
<p>The resources the process is using and receives</p>
<p>The process owner</p>
<p>Signal handling</p>
<p>And basically everything else</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the kernels job to allocate resources to different processes depending on the process demands.</p>
<p>Process Creation</p>
<p>When a process is created, the process that is created gets a PPID, the PPID is the parent process&rsquo;s (the process that started this process) PID</p>
<p>This is called the Fork system.</p>
<p>init: the very first process that starts when the computer turns on. It has a process ID of 1</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t be terminated unless the system shuts down. Also runs with root privileges.</p>
<p>runs many processes that keep the system running.</p>
<p>Process Termination</p>
<p>A process can exit using the _exit system call.</p>
<p>When a process wants to terminate, it lets the system know why it&rsquo;s terminating with a termination status.</p>
<p>Status of 0 means that the process succeeded.</p>
<p>the parent process must acknowledge the termination of the child process by using the wait system call.</p>
<p>The wait system call checks the termination status of the child process.</p>
<p>Orphan processes get put under care of init.</p>
<p>Zombie processes</p>
<p>When a child process terminates and a parent hasn&rsquo;t called wait yet. The zombie stays in the process until the parent wait calls it. When a parent calls the zombie it is known as &ldquo;reaping&rdquo; and the zombie will disappear.</p>
<p>if the parent doesn&rsquo;t perform the wait call on the zombie then init will adopt the zombie and wait call it.</p>
<p>Too many zombie processes take up space in the process table. If the process table is filled up it will prevent other processes from running.</p>
<p>Signals</p>
<p>A notification to a process that something has happened.</p>
<p>Why we have signals.</p>
<p>Software interrupts that have a lot of uses.</p>
<p>A user can type one of the special terminal characters (Ctrl-C) or (Ctrl-Z) to kill, interrupt, or suspend processes.</p>
<p>Hardware issues can occur and the kernel wants to notify the process.</p>
<p>Software issues can occur and the kernel wants to notify the process.</p>
<p>They are basically ways processes can communicate.</p>
<p>Signal process.</p>
<p>Signal is generated by some event</p>
<p>Delivered to a process</p>
<p>In a pending state until it is delivered.</p>
<p>When the process is ran, the signal will be delivered.</p>
<p>Processes have signal masks and they can block signals if specified.</p>
<p>After a signal is delivered a process could do a multitude of things:</p>
<p>Ignore the signal</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch&rdquo; the signal and perform a specific handler routine.</p>
<p>Process can be terminated, as opposed to the normal exit system call.</p>
<p>Block the signal, depending on the signal mask.</p>
<p>Common Signals</p>
<p>- Defined by integers with symbolic names that are in the form of SIGxxx.</p>
<p>- SIGHUP or HUP or 1: Hangup</p>
<p>- SIGINT or INT or 2: Interrupt</p>
<p>- SIGKILL or KILL or 9: kill</p>
<p>- SIGSEGV or SEGV or 11: Segmentation fault</p>
<p>- SIGTERM or TERM or 15: Software termination</p>
<p>- SIGSTOP or STOP: Stop</p>
<p>*numbers can vary with signals so they are usually referred by their names.</p>
<p>* some signals are unblockable, one example is the SIGKILL signal. The KILL signal destroys the process.</p>
<p>Kill (Terminate)</p>
<p>$ kill 12445 - signal to kill a process. 12445 is the PID of the process to be killed.</p>
<p>This send a TERM signal. The SIGTERM signal is sent to a process to request it&rsquo;s termination by allowing it to cleanly release its resources and saving it&rsquo;s state.</p>
<p>$ kill -9 12445 - specifying signal -9 (SIGKILL) to kill the process.</p>
<p>- SIGHUP - Hangup, sent to a process when the controlling terminal is closed.</p>
<p>- SIGINT - Is an interrupt signal (Ctrl-C)</p>
<p>- SIGTERM - Kill the process, but allow it to do some cleanup first.</p>
<p>- SIGKILL - Kill the process, kill it with fire, no cleanup</p>
<p>- SIGSTOP - Stop/ suspend a process</p>
<p>niceness</p>
<p>Process take turns sharing the CPU. A nice value can influence the process scheduling algorithm.</p>
<p>Processes have a number to determine the priority for a CPU. High numbers are lower in priority and low numbers or negative are higher in priority. Nice is high not nice is low.</p>
<p>$ top - shows processes with Niceness level under NI column.</p>
<p>$ nice -n 5 apt upgrade - set priority for new process.</p>
<p>$ renice 10 -p 3245 - set priority for an existing process.</p>
<p>Process states</p>
<p>$ ps aux</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>STAT column show values for different states.</p>
<p>- R - running or runnable, waiting for the CPU to process it.</p>
<p>- S - Interruptible sleep, waiting for an even to comeplete, such as input from the terminal.</p>
<p>-D - Uninterruptable sleep - can&rsquo;t be killed or interrupted, only a reboot can make them go away.</p>
<p>- Z - Zombie</p>
<p>- T - Stopped or suspended</p>
<p>/proc filesystem</p>
<p>Processes are stored here</p>
<p>$ ls /proc - there are subdirectories for every PID. Shows all processes in file form. Shows more infor here than in ps</p>
<p>Job Control</p>
<p>Sending a job to the background</p>
<p>sending an ampersand (&amp;) to the command will run it in the background so you can still use your shell.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>$ sleep 1000 &amp;</p>
<p>$ sleep 1001 &amp;</p>

<h1 id="resources-for-learning-linux">Resources for learning Linux</h1>

<p>Going Down the Linux Rabbit Hole</p>
<p>Now that I have finished my CCNA, it&rsquo;s time to go down the Linux rabbit hole. I may or may not be getting any Linux certifications. I mostly just want a foundation of basic Linux and bash scripting skills. This will help expand the areas of technology that I am able to work  with.</p>
<p>After searching Reddit and asking professionals on Discord, these are the beginner friendly resources for learning Linux that I came up with. It should be enough to get anyone started with the basics of Linux and bash.</p>
<p>After finishing all of these and practicing labs I may be a part 2 of this list so we can go even deeper.</p>
<p>The Top Recommended Linux Resource</p>
<p><a href="https://linuxjourney.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">LinuxJourney.com</a></p>
<p>Screenshot from linuxjourney.com</p>
<p>This was the most recommended free resource for learning &ldquo;Linux-Fu&rdquo;. And boy does it deliver. I am currently halfway into this website. It is helping a ton by building the foundations needed to move on to bash projects. LinuxJourney.com has 4 main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grasshopper</li>
<li>Journeyman</li>
<li>Networking Nomad</li>
<li>Recommended Resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Grasshopper</p>
<p>Goes over Linux distributions, command line navigation, text programs, user management, permissions, processes and packages.</p>
<p>Journey man</p>
<p>Covers devices, filesystems, booting, kernel, init, process utilization, and logging.</p>
<p>Networking</p>
<p>Goes over basics like network sharing, subnetting, routing, network configuration, troubleshooting, and DNS.</p>
<p>Recommended resources</p>
<p>Gives four additional books to learn Linux.</p>
<p>Widely Recommended Book</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Command-Shell-Scripting-Bible/dp/111898384X/ref=sr_1_4?crid=23ZFYBA3DCPAN&keywords=linux+command+line+and+shell+scripting+bible&qid=1640795320&sprefix=linux+command+line+and+shell%2Caps%2C120&sr=8-4" rel="external" target="_blank">Linux Command Line and Shell Scripting Bible</a></p>
<p>This book was recommended by pretty much everyone I talked to on Reddit. By the looks of it, it is filled with very practical knowledge and projects. The Shell Scripting Bible is separated into four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Linux Command Line</li>
<li>Shell Scripting Basics</li>
<li>Advanced Shell Scripting</li>
<li>Creating Practical Scripts</li>
</ul>
<p>Epic Udemy Course</p>
<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-shell-scripting-projects/" rel="external" target="_blank">Linux Shell Scripting: A Project-Based Approach to Learning</a></p>
<p>I like to include a video course in my learning. That is why I found a highly rated Udemy course. You can pick this course up for $12.86 when it is on sale. This will give some perspective on how to put all of this information about Linux to good use.</p>
<p>This project-based approach to learning includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a Local Linux Shell Scripting Environment</li>
<li>User and Account Creation</li>
<li>Password Generation and Shell Script Arguments</li>
<li>Linux Programming Conventions</li>
<li>Parsing Command Line Options</li>
<li>Transforming Data/ Data Processing/ Reporting</li>
<li>Network Scripting &amp; Automation of Distributed Systems</li>
<li>Some extras</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty excited about this one. Reading textbooks can be boring. Really needed a way to put Linux into practical use as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Why Linux?</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not sure if any Linux certifications like Linux +, Linux Essentials, or LPIC-1 hold much weight. And I don&rsquo;t think I need to go as deep as an RHCSA in order to do Bash scripting. Please let me know if one of these basic Linux certs have changed your career.</p>
<p>I do think having some foundational Linux skills would boost anyone&rsquo;s resume and technical abilities. It will also give you the foundations to move onto Python scripting, ethical hacking, etc.</p>
<p>Well, there are your beginner friendly resources for learning Linux. Please let me know if there is anything else that should be on this list. I am after all, a Linux noob.</p>

<h1 id="rhcsa-lab-using-vagrant">RHCSA Lab Using Vagrant</h1>

<p><a href="#R-image-82b41351a1a14042f56c9469a3babbcc" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="RHCSA Vagrant Lab" class="noborder lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/images/vagrantmultivmdeployment.jpg?width=600px" style=" height: auto; width: 600px;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-82b41351a1a14042f56c9469a3babbcc"><img alt="RHCSA Vagrant Lab" class="noborder lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/images/vagrantmultivmdeployment.jpg?width=600px"></a></p>
<p>We are going to use Vagrant to set up two RHEL 8 servers with some custom configuration options. I will include some helpful Vagrant commands at the end if you get stuck.</p>
<p>In this guide, I will be using Fedora 38 as my main operating system. I use Fedora because it is similar in features to Red Hat Linux Distributions. This will give me even more practice for the RHCSA exam as I use it in day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>Note, if you are using Windows, you will need to install ssh. This can be done by installing Git. Which automatically installs ssh for you.</p>
<p>You will also need to have the latest version of Virtualbox installed.</p>
<h2 id="here-are-the-steps">Here are the steps:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download and install Vagrant</li>
<li>Make a new directory for your vagrant lab to live in</li>
<li>Add the vagrant box</li>
<li>Install the Vagrant disk size plugin</li>
<li>Initialize the Vagrant box and Edit the Vagrant file</li>
<li>Bring up the Vagrant box</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-download-and-install-vagrant">1. Download and install Vagrant.</h3>
<p>In Fedora, this is very easy. Run the following command to download and install Vagrant:</p>
<p><code>sudo dnf install vagrant</code></p>
<h3 id="2-make-a-new-directory-for-your-vagrant-lab-to-live-in">2. Make a new directory for your vagrant lab to live in.</h3>
<p>Make your vagrant directory and make it your current working directory:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-mkdir" data-lang="mkdir">cd Vagrant</code></pre></div><ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Add the Vagrant box.
<code>vagrant box add generic/rhel8</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install the Vagrant disk size plugin.
The disk size program will help us set up custom storage sizes. Since we will be re-partitioning storage, this is a useful feature.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><code>vagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize</code></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Initialize the Vagrant box and edit the Vagrant file.
First, initialize the Vagrant box in the vagrant directory:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>vagrant init generic/rhel8</code></p>
<p>After completion, there will now be a file called &ldquo;Vagrantfile&rdquo; in your current directory. Since Vim is on the RHCSA exam, it&rsquo;s wise to practice with it whenever you can. So let&rsquo;s open the file in Vim:</p>
<p><code>vim Vagrantfile</code></p>
<p>You will see a bunch of lines commented out, and a few lines without comments. Go ahead and comment out everything and paste this at the end of the file:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Vagrant.configure(&#34;2&#34;) do |config


config.vm.box = &#34;generic/rhel8&#34;


config.vm.define &#34;server1&#34; do |server1|


server1.vm.hostname = &#34;server1.example.com&#34;


server1.vm.network &#34;private_network&#34;, ip: &#34;192.168.2.110&#34;


config.disksize.size = &#39;10GB&#39;


end


config.vm.define &#34;server2&#34; do |server2|


server2.vm.hostname = &#34;server2.example.com&#34;


server2.vm.network &#34;private_network&#34;, ip: &#34;192.168.2.120&#34;


config.disksize.size = &#39;16GB&#39;


end


config.vm.provider &#34;virtualbox&#34; do |vb|


vb.memory = &#34;2048&#34;


end


end|</code></pre></div><p>The configuration file is fairly self-explanatory. Save Vagrantfile and exit Vim. Then, create /etc/vbox/networks.conf and add the following:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>* 10.0.0.0/8 192.168.0.0/1
* 2001::/646</code></pre></div><p>This will allow you to be more flexible with what network addresses can be used in VirtualBox.</p>
<h2 id="bring-up-the-vagrant-box">Bring up the Vagrant box.</h2>
<p>Now, we bring up the Vagrant box. This will open two Virtual machines in Virtualbox named server1 and server2 in headless mode (there is no GUI).</p>
<p><code>vagrant up</code></p>
<p>Great! Now we can use Vagrant to ssh into server1:</p>
<p><code>vagrant ssh server 1</code></p>
<p>From server1 ssh into server2 using its IP address:</p>
<p><code>[vagrant@server1 ~]$ ssh 192.168.2.120</code></p>
<p>Now you are in and ready to stir things up. The last thing you need is some commands to manage your Vagrant machines.</p>
<h2 id="helpful-vagrant-commands">Helpful Vagrant commands.</h2>
<p>Shut down Vagrant machines:</p>
<p><code>vagrant halt</code>
Suspend or resume a machine:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>vagrant suspend
vagrand resume</code></pre></div><p>Restart a virtual machine:</p>
<p><code>vagrant reload</code></p>
<p>Destroy a Vagrant machine:</p>
<p><code>vagrant destroy [machine-name]</code></p>
<p>Show running VMs:</p>
<p><code>vagrant status</code></p>
<p>List other Vagrant options:</p>
<p><code>vagrant</code></p>
<p>If you are going for RHCSA, there is no doubt that you will also use Vagrant sometime in the future. And as you can see, it&rsquo;s pretty quick and simple to get started.</p>

<h1 id="skills-that-go-with-bash-scripting">Skills that go with Bash Scripting</h1>

<p>What are supplementary skills that go well with Bash Scripting for landing a job in Systems Administration?</p>
<p>I went through Dozens of job listings that mentioned Bash Scripting. I then tallied up devices/ vendors, certifications, and technologies mentioned. I left out anything that wasn&rsquo;t mentioned more than twice.</p>
<p>The point here is to target the most sought after technologies and skills by employers. And lastly, I left out soft skills and any job that wasn&rsquo;t a Systems Administration specific role.</p>

<p>stdout (Standard Out)</p>
<p>I/O (input/output streams)</p>
<p>$ echo Hello World  &gt; Peanuts.txt</p>
<p>Writes Hello World to a new file called Peanuts.txt</p>
<p>Processes use I/O streams to receive input and return output.</p>
<p>echo takes the input of the keyboard and returns it as output to the screen. &gt; Is an I/O redirection operator that changes where the standard output goes. if the file already exist the contents will be overwritten.</p>
<p>$ echo Hello World &raquo; Peanuts.txt</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; is used to add the output to the end of the file instead of overwriting it. This will also create Peanuts.txt if it doesn&rsquo;t already exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>stdin (Standard In) &lt;</p>
<p>cat &lt; peanuts.txt &gt; banana.txt</p>
<p>inputs cat to peanuts.txt and outputs to Banana.txt</p>
<p>stderr (Standard Error)</p>
<p>$ ls /fake/directory &gt; peanuts.txt</p>
<p>trying to ls a directory that doesn&rsquo;t exist</p>
<p>Output: ls: cannot access /fake/directory: No such file or directory</p>
<p>This does not output to peanut.txt because you cannot output a stderror the same way as stdout.</p>
<p>Use a file descriptor to do this. This is a non-negative number that is used to access a file or stream.</p>
<p>The file descriptor for stdin, stdout, and stderr is 0,1, and 2 respectively.</p>
<p>Redirect stderr to a file</p>
<p>$ ls /fake/directory 2&gt; peanuts.txt</p>
<p>To see both stderr and stdout in a file</p>
<p>$ ls /fake/directory &gt; peanuts.txt 2&gt;&amp;1</p>
<p>There is a shorter way to redirect both stdout and stderr to a file</p>
<p>$ ls /fake/directory &amp;&gt; peanuts.txt</p>
<p>To get rid of stderr messages completely</p>
<p>$ ls fake/directory 2&gt; /dev/null</p>
<p>redirects output to /dev/null</p>
<p>pipe and tee</p>
<p>$ ls -la /etc | less</p>
<p>| allows us to take the stdout of a command and make that the stdin to another process.</p>
<p>$ ls | tee peanuts.txt</p>
<p>tee writes the output to two different streams.</p>
<p>env (Environment)</p>
<p>Environment variables store info to variables in your specific user environment.</p>
<p>$ echo $HOME</p>
<p>Shows what is stored in the HOME variable</p>
<p>$ echo $USER</p>
<p>Shows what is stored in the USER variable</p>
<p>$ env</p>
<p>Shows all environment info used by shell and other processes</p>
<p>You can access a variable by placing $ in front of it like the above examples</p>
<p>The system will check the paths in the PATH variable for the command you are trying to run. If it is not in any of those paths then it will not find the command. If you downloaded a tool and place the commands in a path not listed then it will not find the tool when you run the command. You can include other paths in this list.</p>
<p>cut</p>
<p>$ cut -c 5 file.txt</p>
<p>outputs the 5th character in each line of file.txt space also counts as a character.</p>
<p>$ cut -f 2 file.txt</p>
<p>-f flag sorts by fields. Fields are separated by tabs. So this would output the field after the first tab which is the second field.</p>
<p>$ cut -f  1 -d &ldquo;;&rdquo; file.txt</p>
<p>Changes tab delimiter to a ; delimiter</p>
<p>paste</p>
<p>$ paste -s file2.txt</p>
<p>combines file2.txt into one line using tabs to separate. -s makes everything go on one line.</p>
<p>$ paste -d &rsquo; &rsquo; -s file2.txt</p>
<p>changes the delimiter to a space</p>
<p>head</p>
<p>by default, the head command will show you the first 10 lines in a file</p>
<p>$ head /var/log/syslog</p>
<p>shows the first 10 lines in /var/log/syslog</p>
<p>$ head -n 15 /var/log/syslog</p>
<p>-n flag is for number of lines, this would output 15 lines. You can output as many lines as you want.</p>
<p>tail</p>
<p>Shows last 10 lines of file by default</p>
<p>$ tail /var/log/syslog</p>
<p>$ tail -n 15 /var/log/syslog</p>
<p>Shows 15 lines instead of 10</p>
<p>$ tail -f /var/log/syslog</p>
<p>-f will follow the file as it grows</p>
<p>Expand and Unexpand</p>
<p>$ expand sample.txt</p>
<p>converts any tabs in the file to a series of spaces.</p>
<p>$ expand file.txt &gt; spacefile.txt</p>
<p>put that output into a new file</p>
<p>$ unexpand -a result.txt</p>
<p>converts spaces back to tabs</p>
<p>Join and Split</p>
<p>$ join file1.txt file2.txt</p>
<p>Joined via matching list fields</p>
<p>-1 refers to file3.txt -2 refers to list2.txt and specifies the field from each file that you want.</p>
<p>$ split somefile</p>
<p>splits into different files by default it will split them once they reach a 1000 line limit. The files are names x** by default</p>
<p>sort</p>
<p>useful for sorting lines</p>
<p>$ sort file.txt</p>
<p>Sorts file in alphabetical order</p>
<p>$  sort  -r file.txt</p>
<p>-r flag reverses the order of the sort</p>
<p>$ sort -n file.txt</p>
<p>sorts by numerical value</p>
<p>tr (Translate)</p>
<p>allows you to translate a set of characters into another set of characters</p>
<p>$ tr a-z A-Z</p>
<p>hello</p>
<p>HELLO</p>
<p>uniq (Unique)</p>
<p>Useful tool for parsing text.</p>
<p>$ uniq reading.txt</p>
<p>Outputs contents of reading.txt without duplicates.</p>
<p>$ uniq -c reading.txt</p>
<p>Outputs a count of each word</p>
<p>$ unique -u reading.txt</p>
<p>Outputs only unique words</p>
<p>$ unique -d reading.txt</p>
<p>Only outputs duplicate values</p>
<p>This will not detect duplicate lines if they are not adjacent</p>
<p>To overcome this limitation:</p>
<p>$ sort reading.txt | uniq</p>
<p>This will output duplicated because the sort puts all of the duplicates together first.</p>
<p>wc and nl</p>
<p>The wc (word count) command shows the total count of words in a file</p>
<p>$ wc /etc/passwd</p>
<p>Output: 96  265  5925 /etc/passwd</p>
<p>displays number of lines, number of words, and number of bytes respectively</p>
<p>To just see the count of a certain field, use the -l, -w, or -c respectively</p>
<p>$ wc -l /etc/psswd</p>
<p>$ nl file.txt</p>
<p>shows number of lines in the file</p>
<p>grep</p>
<p>Allows you to search files for characters that match a certain pattern. Like if a string is in a certain file or file in a certain directory.</p>
<p>$ grep fox sample.txt</p>
<p>looks for fox</p>
<p>$ grep -i somepattern somefile</p>
<p>looks for patterns that are case insensitive</p>
<p>$ env | grep -i User</p>
<p>Grabs User from env without needing CAPS for USER variable</p>
<p>$ ls /somedir | grep &lsquo;.txt$&rsquo;</p>
<p>returns all files ending with .txt in somedi</p>

<h1 id="the-linux-filesystem">The Linux Filesystem</h1>

<p>Filesystem Hierarchy</p>
<p>$ ls -l /</p>
<p>/ - The root directory of the entire filesystem hierarchy, everything is nested under this directory.</p>
<p>/bin - Essential ready-to-run programs (binaries), includes the most basic commands such as ls and cp.</p>
<p>/boot - Contains kernal boot loader files.</p>
<p>/dev - Device files.</p>
<p>/etc - Core system configuration directory, should hold only configuration files and not any binaries.</p>
<p>/home - Personal directories for users</p>
<p>/lib - Holds library files that binaries can use.</p>
<p>/media - Used as an attachment point for removable media like USB drives.</p>
<p>/mnt - Temporarily mounted filesystems</p>
<p>/opt - Optional application software packages.</p>
<p>/proc - info about currently running processes</p>
<p>/root - The root user&rsquo;s home directory</p>
<p>/run - information about the running system since the last boot.</p>
<p>/sbin - Contains essential system binaries, usually can only be ran by root.</p>
<p>/srv - Site-specific data which are served by the system.</p>
<p>/tmp - Storage for temporary files</p>
<p>/usr - Meant for user installed software and utilities. Inside this directory are sub directories for /usr/bin, /usr/local, etc.</p>
<p>/var - Variable directory, used for system logging, user tracking, caches, etc. Things that are subject to change all the time.</p>
<p>Filesystem Types</p>
<p>Virtual File System (VFS) abstraction layer.</p>
<p>The layer between appllications and the different file system types.</p>
<p>Journaling</p>
<p>Comes by default on MOST filesystem types. A log file that keeps track of what you are doing when moving files. Will keep track of where you left off in case the system loses power.</p>
<p>Common Desktop Filesystem types</p>
<p>ext4 - This is the most current version of native Linux filesystems. Compatible with the older ext2 and ext3 versions. Supports disk volumes up to 1 exabyte and file sizes up yo 16 terabytes and more. Standard choice for Linux filesystems.</p>
<p>Btrfs - &ldquo;Better or Butter FS&rdquo; it is a new filesystem for Linux that comes with snapshots, incremental backups, performance increase and much more. It is widely available, but not quite stable/ compatible yet.</p>
<p>XFS - High performance journaling file system, great for system with large files such as media server,</p>
<p>NTFS and FAT - Windows Filesystems</p>
<p>HFS+ - Macintosh filesystem</p>
<p>$ df -T</p>
<p>reports filesystem  disk space usage and other details about your disk.</p>
<p>Anatomy of a disk</p>
<p>Partition table</p>
<p>Every disk has a partition tables that shows the system how the disk is partitioned. It shows how partitions begin and end, which partitions are bootable, what sectors of the disk are allocated to what partition, etc. There are two main partition tables schemes used, Master Boot Record (MBR) and GUID Partition Table (GAPT)</p>
<p>Partition</p>
<p>Partitions can&rsquo;t overlap each other. Free space is disk space that is not allocated to a partition.</p>
<p>MBR</p>
<p>- Traditional partition table</p>
<p>- Can have primary, extended, and logical partitions</p>
<p>- MBR has a limit of four primary partitions</p>
<p>- Additional partitions can be made by making a primary partition into an extended partition (there can only be one extended partition on a disk). Then inside the extended partition you add logical partitions.</p>
<p>- Supports disks up to 2 Terabytes.</p>
<p>GPT</p>
<p>- GUID Partition Table (GPT) is becoming the new standard for disk partitioning.</p>
<p>- Has only one type of partition and you can make many of them.</p>
<p>- Used mostly in conjunction with UEFI based booting</p>
<p>Filesystem structure</p>
<p>Boot block</p>
<p>Located int the first few sectors of the filesystem. It is not really used by the filesystem. It contains information used to boot the operating system. Only one boot block is needed by the operating system. There are unused boot blocks in partitions that don&rsquo;t have boot info.</p>
<p>Super block</p>
<p>A single block that comes after the boot block that contains info about the filesystem. Info includes the size of the inode table, size of logical blocks , and size of the filesystem.</p>
<p>Inode table</p>
<p>The database that manages files. Each file or directory has a unique entry in the inode table and it has various info about the file.</p>
<p>Data blocks</p>
<p>The actual data for the files and directories.</p>
<p>$ sudo  parted -l</p>
<p>to view a partition table</p>

<p>( MBR example )</p>
<p>Disk Partitioning</p>
<p>Tools to partition a disk</p>
<p>fdisk - basic command-line partitioning tool, it does not support GPT</p>
<p>parted - command line tool that supports both MBR and GPT partitioning</p>
<p>gparted - GUI version of parted</p>
<p>gdisk - fdisk, but only supports GPT</p>
<p>$ sudo parted</p>
<p>Enters the parted tool</p>
<p>select /dev/sdb2</p>
<p>selects the device</p>
<p>mkpart primary 123 4567</p>
<p>to make the partition</p>
<p>$ resize 2 1234 3456</p>
<p>to resize a partition. Select the partition number and then start and end points of where you want to resize it to.</p>
<p>Creating filesystems</p>
<p>$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb2</p>
<p>Allows you to specify the type of filesystem and where it goes. You only want to create a filesystem on a newly partitioned disk or if you are repartitioning an old one. (Otherwise it will probably get corrupted.</p>
<p>Mount and umount</p>
<p>A new filesystem must be mounted before you can view its contents. You want to mount it to a mount point.</p>
<p>What you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device Location</li>
<li>Filesystem type</li>
<li>Mount point</li>
</ul>
<p>Mount Point = Directory that the filesystem attaches to:</p>
<p>Mount filesystem</p>
<p>$ sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb2 /mydrive</p>
<p>Unmount</p>
<p>$ sudo umount /mydrive</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>$ sudo umount /dev/sdb2</p>
<ul>
<li>Kernel names devices in the order it finds them</li>
<li>Device name could change after you mount it</li>
<li>You can use the devices UUID to identify it instead of a name</li>
</ul>
<p>View UUIDs for block devices (device name, UUID, filesystem type</p>
<p>$ sudo blkid</p>
<p>Mount w/ UUID</p>
<p>$ sudo mount UUID=(insert ID here) /my drive</p>
<ul>
<li>Secondary hard drives must be mounted by UUID</li>
</ul>
<p>/etc/fstab (&ldquo;eff es tab&rdquo;) (filesystem table)</p>
<ul>
<li>List of mounted filesystems</li>
</ul>
<p>Show contents of /etc/fstab (UUID, mount point, filesystem type, options dump, pass)</p>
<p>$ cat /etc/fstab</p>
<p>Dump = used by dumb utility to decide when to take a backup (default is 0)</p>
<p>Pass = used by fsck to decide what order to check filesystems - value of 0 will not be checked</p>
<ul>
<li>You can add an entry manually by editing the file syntax matching other entries</li>
</ul>
<p>SWAP</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage if you are low on memory</li>
<li>Space for idle processes to go to make room in RAM</li>
<li>Allocate twice as much swap as memory (usually)</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps to use a partition as swap space:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use an empty partition</li>
<li>Initialize swap areas</li>
</ol>
<p>$ mkswap /dev/sdb2</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable swap device</li>
</ol>
<p>$ swapon  /sdb2/dev</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add entry to /etc/fstab (so this swap partition persists on bootup)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use &ldquo;sw&rdquo; for filesystem type</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remove swap</p>
<p>$ swapoff /dev/sdb2</p>
<p>Disk Usage</p>
<p>Show filesystem utilization (disk free)</p>
<p>$ df -h</p>
<ul>
<li>-h = human readable</li>
<li>shows current directory</li>
</ul>
<p>Show filesystem (disk usage)</p>
<p>$ du -h</p>
<ul>
<li>See what files are taking up space in the current directory</li>
</ul>
<p>Show disk usage for root</p>
<p>$ du -h /</p>
<p>Filesystem Repair</p>
<ul>
<li>Sudden shutdowns can corrupt data</li>
</ul>
<p>Filesystem check (fsck)</p>
<ul>
<li>Check consistency of a filesystem</li>
<li>Attempt to repair filesystem</li>
<li>Ran before disk is mounted on boot</li>
</ul>
<p>Run fsck Manually (from a rescue disk because filesystem being checked cannot be mounted)</p>
<p>$ sudo fsck /dev/sda</p>
<p>Inodes (Index Nodes)</p>
<p>The Filesystem</p>
<p>Inodes (Index Nodes)</p>
<p>Inode Table: database that manages files in the filesystem</p>
<p>Inode: Entry in the inode table that describes each file (1 Inode for each file)</p>
<p>Every # must be unique</p>
<p>cannot be referenced across different filesystems</p>
<p>Contains:</p>
<p>filetype</p>
<p>- regular</p>
<p>- directory</p>
<p>- Character device</p>
<p>- etc.</p>
<p>owner</p>
<p>group</p>
<p>Access Permissions</p>
<p>Timestamps</p>
<p>- mtime (time last modified)</p>
<p>- ctime (attribute change)</p>
<p>- atime (last access)</p>
<p># of hardlinks</p>
<p>File Sizw</p>
<p># of blocks</p>
<p>Pointers to data blocks (important)</p>
<p>Does not contain the filename or the file itself</p>
<p>When inodes are created</p>
<p>Space for inodes is allocated when the filesystem is created</p>
<p>Algorithm determines amount of space needed</p>
<p>out of inode space errors can occur</p>
<p>View inodes/ how many are left:</p>
<p>$ df -i</p>
<p>Inode Information</p>
<p>Identified by numbers</p>
<p>files get inode number when they are created</p>
<p>numbers are assigned in sequential order</p>
<p>numbers are reused after the old inode is deleted</p>
<p>view inode numbers</p>
<p>$ls -li</p>
<p>View detailed info about file and the inode</p>
<p>$stat ~/Desktop/</p>
<p>How Inodes locate files</p>
<p>point to files in the data blocks</p>
<p>usually contain 15 pointers</p>
<p>13th pointer points to block containing other pointers</p>
<p>14th pointer points to more pointers</p>
<p>15th pointer points to more pointers</p>
<p>1st 12 pointers can find small files quickly</p>
<p>Symlinks (symbolic links)</p>
<p>3rd field in ls command is link count (hard links)</p>
<p>equivalent of windows shortcuts</p>
<p>Hard Link= file with a link to an inode</p>
<p>Create a symlink</p>
<p>$ln -s myfile myfile4</p>
<p>ls -li</p>
<p>1598657 -rw-rw-r&ndash; 1 david.thomas david.thomas 7 Jul 21 14:19 myfile</p>
<p>1581638 lrwxrwxrwx 1 david.thomas david.thomas 6 Aug 4 14:21 myfile4 -&gt; myfile</p>
<p>New inode is created</p>
<p>File gets modified</p>
<p>Can be referenced accross different filesystems</p>
<p>Hardlinks</p>
<p>Hard link a file</p>
<p>$ln myfile myhardlinkls</p>
<p>Will show the same inode#</p>
<p>Modifications to one file will change both</p>
<p>Link count goes down when file is removed</p>
<p>Inode gets deleted once all hardlinks are removed</p>

<h1 id="user-management">User Management</h1>

<p>Users and groups</p>
<p>Exist soley for access and permissions</p>
<p>home/ username : where each user&rsquo;s specific files get stored</p>
<p>can vary in different distros</p>
<p>user ids (UID) are used to manage users. The system identifies user by UID.</p>
<p>Groups are also used to manage permissions</p>
<p>sets of users with permissions set by that group</p>
<p>system identifies groups by group ID (GID)</p>
<p>users can be humans or system daemons that run processes to keep the system running</p>
<p>root or superuser</p>
<p>can access any file or start or terminate any process</p>
<p>$ sudo</p>
<p>used to run a command with root access</p>
<p>$ls -la /etc/shadow</p>
<p>views permissions of /etc/shadow</p>
<p>Root</p>
<p>$  su</p>
<p>opens a root shell if no user is specified</p>
<p>/etc/sudoers</p>
<p>lists users who can run sudo</p>
<p>$visudo</p>
<p>to edit the sudoers file</p>
<p>/etc/passwd</p>
<p>to find what users are mapped to what UID, shows list of users and detailed information about them.</p>
<p>$cat /etc/passwd</p>
<p>root:x:0:0;root:/root:/bin/bash</p>
<p>From left to right from above:</p>
<p>Username</p>
<p>User&rsquo;s password</p>
<p>x means the password is stored in the /etc/shadow file</p>
<p>* means the user doesn&rsquo;t have login access</p>
<p>blank field means the user doesn&rsquo;t have a password</p>
<p>user ID</p>
<p>The group ID</p>
<p>GECOS field - comma delimeted field that allows for comments about the user.</p>
<p>User&rsquo;s home directory</p>
<p>User&rsquo;s shell</p>
<p>You can edit the /etc/passwd file by hand with the vipw tool but it is best to leave it to useradd and userdel tools</p>
<p>/etc/shadow</p>
<p>$sudo cat/etc/shadow</p>
<p>root:MyEPTEa$6Nonsense:15000:0:99999:7:::</p>
<p>Left to right from above</p>
<p>Username</p>
<p>Encrypted password</p>
<p>Date of last password change - expressed as the number of days since Jan 1, 1970. If 0 then the user should change their password the next time they log in.</p>
<p>Minimum password age - days the user will have to wait before changing their password again.</p>
<p>Maximum password age - Maximum number of days before a user has to change their password.</p>
<p>Password warning period - Number of days before a password is going to expire</p>
<p>Password inactivity period - # of days after a password has expired  to allow login with their password.</p>
<p>Account expiration date - date that user will not be able to log in.</p>
<p>Reserved field  for future use.</p>
<p>In most distributions today, user authentication doesn&rsquo;t rely on just the /etc/shadow file, there are other mechanisms in place such as PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) that replace authentication.</p>

<h1 id="run-command-as-another-user">Run Command as Another User</h1>

<p>To invoke a login shell using <code>sudo</code> just use <code>-i</code>. When command is not specified you&rsquo;ll get a login shell prompt, otherwise you&rsquo;ll get the output of your command.</p>
<p>Example (login shell):</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#e2e4e5;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo -i</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Example (with a specified user):</p>

<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#e2e4e5;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo -i -u user <span style="color:#ff5c57">echo</span> <span style="color:#5af78e">\$</span>HOME</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Note: The backslash character ensures that the dollar sign reaches the target user&rsquo;s shell and is not interpreted in the calling user&rsquo;s shell.</p>
<p>I have just checked the last example with <em>strace</em> which tells you exactly what&rsquo;s happening. The output bellow shows that the shell is being called with <code>--login</code> and with the specified command, just as in your explicit call to bash, but in addition <em>sudo</em> can do its own work like setting the <code>$HOME</code>.</p>

When your Lab reservation begins, you will receive several emails communicating important information about the status of your Lab.</p>
<p>The first email is sent to you from the Lab provisioning automation engine, and indicates that resources in your Lab are in the process of being provisioned and tested. Your Lab is NOT READY yet, but this email will give an estimate of when your Lab will be available.</p>
<p>The second email will be sent to you when your Lab is fully provisioned, tested and READY for you to connect. In this email you&rsquo;ll find the information required by AnyConnect to establish a VPN connection to your Lab (Network IP Address, VPN Username, VPN Password).</p>

<h1 id="cisco-vlan-lab">Cisco VLAN Lab</h1>

<p>This lab covers some basic LAN setup. Real world networks are a lot bigger than this but once you can configure these things. Troubleshooting and setting up bigger networks will be less challenging.</p>
<p>Here are the settings to configure:</p>
<ul>
<li>VLAN setup using VTP</li>
<li>Trunking using DTP</li>
<li>Router on a stick</li>
<li>Spanning Tree</li>
<li>Etherchannel</li>
</ul>
<p>Your goal with this lab is to configure all of the settings above and verify using show commands. And test your working network with pings between all of the PCs. Finally, you will download a broken version of the lab and use your troubleshooting skills to fix it.</p>
<p>The PCs have all been configured with IP addresses and default gateways for their respective VLANs.</p>
<p>Packet Tracer files for this lab</p>
<p>Set up trunk ports on all switches using DTP</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need to set up trunk ports using dtp between all of the switches. Switch1s port connecting to router1 should also be a trunk link. Then verify the trunk connections.</p>
<p>Each interface you see here should be a trunk port.</p>
<p>Set all used ports on switch1 to &ldquo;dynamic desirable&rdquo;. Later we will disable DTP and manually set up the trunk links.</p>
<p>switch1 (config) # int ra fa0/1-6<br>
switch1 (config-if-range) # switchport mode dynamic desirable</p>
<p>Verify trunk links on switches 3-5 leading to switch1</p>
<p>You should see trunks connecting to switch1 since dtp is set to &ldquo;dynamic auto&rdquo; by default on the other switches.</p>
<p>switch3 # show interfaces trunk</p>
<p>Remove the dynamic desirable command</p>
<p>All of that work you did to get the trunks up using DTP? Let&rsquo;s start all over and configure them manually instead.</p>
<p>You know.. just for fun.</p>
<p>switch1 (config-if) # no switchport dynamic desirable</p>
<p>Manually Configure Trunks</p>
<p>DTP is usually disabled for security purposes. So we will configure the trunks manually.</p>
<p>Designate trunk ports with 802.1q encapsulation</p>
<p>Depending on the switch, you may or may not have to do this.</p>
<p>switch3 (config-int) # switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q</p>
<p>Set switch port mode to trunk</p>
<p>switch1 # interface range fa0/1-6<br>
switch1 (config-if) # switchport mode trunk</p>
<p>Disable dtp</p>
<p>switch1 (config-if) # switchport nonegotiate</p>
<p>Show switchport info on a single interface</p>
<p>switch1 # show interfaces fa0/4 switchport</p>
<p>Use VTP to Populate VLANs</p>
<p>VTP is not on the current CCNA exam objectives. However, I&rsquo;ve seen this in the real world so it&rsquo;s good to know how it works and how to configure it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that you may see questions on the exam about VTP anyway.</p>
<p>Set up VLANs on switch1</p>
<p>This lab uses VLAN 10, 20, and 30 in networks that match their respective VLAN number. With VLAN 100 being an unused VLAN for security.</p>
<ul>
<li>VLAN 10: 10.0.0.0 /24</li>
<li>VLAN 20: 20.0.0.0 /24</li>
<li>VLAN 30: 30.0.0.0 /24</li>
<li>VLAN 100: NA</li>
</ul>
<p>switch 1 (config) # vlan 10<br>
switch 1 (config) # vlan 20<br>
switch 1 (config) # vlan 30<br>
switch 1 (config) # vlan 100</p>
<p>Set switch1 to VTP mode &ldquo;server&rdquo;</p>
<p>switch1 (config) # vtp mode server</p>
<p>Set the VTP domain name</p>
<p>switch1 (config) # vtp domain cisco</p>
<p>Set the other switches to VTP &ldquo;client&rdquo; mode</p>
<p>switch2 (config) # vtp mode client</p>
<p>Confirm VTP settings</p>
<p>switch2 # show vtp status</p>
<p>Confirm VLANs are set up on all switches</p>
<p>switch2 # show vlan brief</p>
<p>Disable VTP on all switches</p>
<p>switch1 (config) # vtp mode transparent</p>
<p>Final VLAN Pieces</p>
<p>Now that your trunks and VLANs are configured. You can assign some ports to the VLANs. Then block the unused VLAN 100 on all of your trunk links.</p>
<p>Set up access ports connected to PCs</p>
<p>Set the switchport type to &ldquo;access&rdquo;. Then assign that access port to it&rsquo;s respective VLAN.</p>
<p>switch3 (config-int) # switchport mode access<br>
switch3 (config-int) # switchport access vlan 10</p>
<p>Remove VLAN 100 from all trunks</p>
<p>switch1 (config-int) # switchport trunk allowed vlan remove 100</p>
<p>Create a Router on a Stick</p>
<p>Make sure interface gi0/0 does not have an ip address</p>
<p>router1 # show ip interface brief</p>
<p>Create subinterfaces on router and assign ip addresses to them</p>
<ul>
<li>gi0/1.10</li>
<li>gi0/1.20</li>
<li>gi0/1.30</li>
</ul>
<p>router1 # interface gi0/1.10<br>
router1 (config-if) # ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0<br>
router1 (config-if) # encapsulation dot1q 10</p>
<p>Set port on opposing switch to trunk mode</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need to make sure the switch1 port connecting to router1 is a trunk link. This is so that all VLANs can travel to router1 for routing.</p>
<p>The PCs are already configured to use router1 as their default gateway. Assuming you configure the subinterfaces with the .1 ip address for their respective VLANS</p>
<p>Spanning Tree Protocol</p>
<p>This is a very simplified Spanning Tree lab. Leave a comment if you&rsquo;d like a more detailed one in the future.</p>
<p>Optimize spanning tree for best path</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to make switch1 the root bridge for Spanning Tree. To do this, make switch1 have the lowest priority. Or manually set it as the root bridge with the &ldquo;primary&rdquo; command.</p>
<p>This setting should be configured for each VLAN.</p>
<p>Set the priority to change the root bridge</p>
<p>switch1 (config) # spanning-tree vlan 10 priority 24,576</p>
<p>Change the root bridge with the primary command</p>
<p>This will set the switches priority from 32,868 to 24,586. (24,576 + 10 for VLAN 10) The lowest priority will win the root election.</p>
<p>switch1 (config) # spanning-tree vlan 10 root primary</p>
<p>View spanning tree information</p>
<p>switch1 # show spanning-tree</p>
<p>View STP information on a specific VLAN</p>
<p>switch1 # show spanning-tee vlan 10</p>
<p>Show summary of Spanning Tree</p>
<p>switch1 # show spanning-tree summary</p>
<p>Enable PortFast on access ports for switches 3-5</p>
<p>You can set each interface manually. Or you can enable portfast on all non trunking ports with the &ldquo;default&rdquo; option.</p>
<p>switch3 (config-if) # spanning-tree portfast</p>
<p>Enable BPDU Guard on all interfaces with PortFast</p>
<p>switch3 (config-if) # spanning-tree bpduguard enable</p>
<p>Etherchannel (Layer 2)</p>
<p>ou&rsquo;ll need to make sure that all of the Etherchannel ports are either in access mode or trunk mode. It cannot be a mix of both. Also, I had an error (twice) in Packet Tracer where the P01 interface was stuck on STP listening mode. It would not resolve until I reset Packet Tracer.</p>
<p>Keep in mind when troubleshooting errors that Packet Tracer can be buggy. Your issue may be with PT software and not the IOS configuration.</p>
<p>Set up an Etherchannel using PAGP</p>
<p>switch1 (config-if) # channel-group 1 mode desirable</p>
<p>switch2 (config-if) # channel-group 1 mode desirable/ auto</p>
<p>Set up an Etherchannel using LACP</p>
<p>switch1 (conf-if) # channel-group 1 mode active</p>
<p>switch2 (config-if) # channel-group 1 mode active/ passive</p>
<p>View Etherchannel info</p>
<p>switch1 # show etherchannel 1 port-channel</p>
<p>View Etherchannel summary</p>
<p>switch1 # show etherchannel summary</p>
<p>Modify Etherchannel load distribution</p>
<p>switch1 # port-channel load-balance dst-ip</p>
<p>Show Etherchannel load balance information</p>
<p>switch1 # show etherchannel load-balance</p>
<p>Port Security</p>
<p>Implement port security and add an unauthorized device.</p>
<p>View port security details</p>
<p>switch3 # show port-security interface fa 0/3</p>
<p>Enable port security</p>
<p>Switch ports must be not be set as dynamic. Set them manually as access ports instead.</p>
<p>switch3 (config-if-range) # switchport mode access<br>
switch3 (config-if-range) # switchport port-security</p>
<p>Using the sticky command</p>
<p>switch3 (config-if-range) # switchport port-security mac-address sticky</p>
<p>Set the maximum allowed mac addresses on a port to 2</p>
<p>switch3 (config-if-range) # switchport port-security maximum 2</p>
<p>Set port violation to &ldquo;protect&rdquo;</p>
<p>switch3 (config-if-range) # switchport port-security violation protect</p>
<p>Set port violation to &ldquo;restrict&rdquo;</p>
<p>switch3 (config-if-range) # switchport port-security violation restrict</p>
<p>Set port violation to &ldquo;shutdown&rdquo;</p>
<p>switch3 (config-if-range) # switchport port-security violation shutdown</p>
<p>Set port security to a single mac-address</p>
<p>switch3 (config-if-range) # switchport port-security mac-address aa.bb.cc.dd.ee.ff</p>
<p>Shutdown unused ports</p>
<p>switch3 (config-if-range) # Shutdown</p>
<p>Place unused ports into an unused vlan</p>
<p>switch3 (config-if-range) # switchport access vlan 100</p>
<p>Bring an interface back up from an &ldquo;err-disabled&rdquo; state</p>
<p>This is optional. To get a port to an err-disabled state, you&rsquo;ll have to plug in an unauthorized PC if using a static mac-address. Or if you are using the maximum allowed option, plug too many PCs into a single port. Either via hub or by unplugging the PCs and plugging new ones in a few times.</p>
<p>switch3 (config-if) # shutdown<br>
switch3 (config-if) # no shutdown</p>
<p>Show port security Info</p>

<p>anyone logged in with SSH at the time Example 9-4’s output was gathered would not have seen the output, even with the logging monitor debug command configured on router R1, without first issuing a terminal monitor command.</p>
<p>all enabled debug options use router CPU, which can cause problems for the router. You can monitor CPU use with the show process cpu command</p>
<p>use caution when using debug commands carefully on production devices.</p>
<p>the more CLI users that receive debug messages, the more CPU that is consumed.</p>
<h2 id="network-time-protocol-ntp">Network Time Protocol (NTP)</h2>
<p>Devices send timestamps to each other with NTP messages, continually exchanging messages, with one device changing its clock to match the other, eventually synchronizing the clocks.</p>
<p>How NTP defines the sources of time data (reference clocks) and how good each time source is (stratum).</p>
<p>Setting the Time and Timezone</p>
<p>NTP works best if you set the device clock to a reasonably close time before enabling the NTP client function with the ntp server command</p>
<p>I should set the time to 8:52 p.m., set the correct date and timezone, and even tell the device to adjust for daylight savings time—and then enable NTP</p>
<p>Example 9-7 shows how to set the date, time, timezone, and daylight savings time.</p>

<p>You should set the first two commands before setting the time of day with the clock set EXEC command because the two configuration commands impact the time that is set.</p>
<p>chose EDT because it is the acronym for daylight savings time in that same EST time zone. Finally, the recurring keyword tells the router to spring forward an hour and fall back an hour automatically over the years.</p>
<p>clock set EXEC command</p>
<p>uses a time syntax with a 24-hour format, not with a 12-hour format plus a.m./p.m.).</p>
<p>The show clock command (issued seconds later) lists that time, but also notes the time as EDT, rather than UTC time.</p>
<p>Basic NTP Configuration</p>
<p>two ntp configuration commands</p>
<p>ntp master {stratum-level}: NTP server mode—the device acts only as an NTP server, and not as an NTP client. The device gets its time information from the internal clock on the device.</p>
<p>ntp server {address | hostname} : NTP client/server mode—the device acts as both client and server. First, it acts as an NTP client, to synchronize time with a server. Once synchronized, the device can then act as an NTP server, to supply time to other NTP clients.</p>

<p>lists a status of synchronized, which confirms the NTP client has completed the process of changing its time to match the server’s time. Any router acting as an NTP client will list “unsynchronized” in that first line until the NTP synchronization process completes with at least one server.

<h3 id="ntp-reference-clock-and-stratum">NTP Reference Clock and Stratum</h3>
<p>Devices that act solely as an NTP server get their time from either internal device hardware or from some external clock using mechanisms other than NTP.</p>
<p>NTP servers and clients use a number to show the perceived accuracy of their reference clock data based on stratum level. The lower the stratum level, the more accurate the reference clock is considered to be. An NTP server that uses its internal hardware or external reference clock sets its own stratum level. Then, an NTP client adds 1 to the stratum level it learns from its NTP server, so that the stratum level increases the more hops away from the original clock source.</p>
<p>For instance, back in Figure 9-5, you can see the NTP primary server (R3) with a stratum of 2. R2, which references R3, adds 1 so it has a stratum of 3. R1 uses R2 as its NTP server, so R1 adds 1 to have a stratum of 4. These increasing stratum levels allow devices to refer to several NTP servers and then use time information from the best NTP server, best being the server with the lowest stratum level.</p>
<p>Routers and switches use the default stratum level of 8 for their internal reference clock based on the default setting of 8 for the stratum level in the ntp master [stratum-level] command. The command allows you to set a value from 1 through 15; in Example 9-8, the ntp master 2 command set router R3’s stratum level to 2.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>NTP considers 15 to be the highest useful stratum level, so any devices that calculate their stratum as 16 consider the time data unusable and do not trust the time. So, avoid setting higher stratum values on the ntp master command.</p>

<p>NTP primary server and NTP secondary server.</p>
<p>An NTP primary server acts only as a server, with a reference clock external to the device, and has a stratum level of 1, like the two NTP primary servers shown in Figure 9-6. NTP secondary servers are servers that use client/server mode as described throughout this section, relying on synchronization with some other NTP server.</p>

<p>After losing their reference clock, R1 and R2 could no longer be useful NTP servers to the rest of the enterprise.</p>
<p>To overcome this potential issue, the routers can also be configured with the ntp master command, resulting in this logic:</p>
<p>Establish an association with the NTP servers per the ntp server command.</p>
<p>Establish an association with your internal clock using the ntp master stratum command.</p>
<p>Set the stratum level of the internal clock (per the ntp master {stratum-level} command) to a higher (worse) stratum level than the Internet-based NTP servers.</p>
<p>Synchronize with the best (lowest) known time source, which will be one of the Internet NTP servers in this scenario</p>
<p>ntp master 7 command, with a much higher stratum,</p>

<p>Devices that support CDP learn information about others by listening for the advertisements sent by other devices.</p>
<p>CDP discovers several useful details from the neighboring Cisco devices:</p>
<p>Device identifier: Typically the host name</p>
<p>Address list: Network and data-link addresses</p>
<p>Port identifier: The interface on the remote router or switch on the other end of the link that sent the CDP advertisement</p>
<p>Capabilities list: Information on what type of device it is (for example, a router or a switch)</p>
<p>Platform: The model and OS level running on the device</p>

<p>the LLDP output in the example does differ from CDP in a few important ways:</p>
<p>LLDP uses B as the capability code for switching, referring to bridge, a term for the device type that existed before switches that performed the same basic functions.</p>
<p>LLDP does not identify IGMP as a capability, while CDP does (I).</p>
<p>CDP lists the neighbor’s platform, a code that defines the device type, while LLDP does not.</p>
<p>LLDP lists capabilities with different conventions (see upcoming Example 9-19).</p>

<p>System Capabilities: What the device can do</p>
<p>Enabled Capabilities: What the device does now with its current configuration</p>
<p>LLDP uses the same messaging concepts as CDP, encapsulating messages directly in data-link headers. Devices do not forward LLDP messages so that LLDP learns only of directly connected neighbors. LLDP does use a different multicast MAC address (0180.C200.000E)</p>
<h3 id="configuring-and-verifying-lldp">Configuring and Verifying LLDP</h3>
<p>Cisco devices default to disable LLDP</p>
<p>LLDP separates the sending and receiving of LLDP messages as separate functions.</p>
<p>LLDP support processing receives LLDP messages on an interface so that the switch or router learns about the neighboring device while not transmitting LLDP messages to the neighboring device.</p>
<p>the commands include options to toggle on|off the transmission of LLDP messages separately from the processing of received messages.</p>
<p>[no] lldp run: A global configuration command that sets the default mode of LLDP operation for any interface that does not have more specific LLDP subcommands (lldp transmit, lldp receive). The lldp run global command enables LLDP in both directions on those interfaces, while no lldp run disables LLDP.</p>
<p>[no] lldp transmit: An interface sub-command that defines the operation of LLDP on the interface regardless of the global [no] lldp run command. The lldp transmit interface subcommand causes the device to transmit LLDP messages, while no lldp transmit causes it to not transmit LLDP messages.</p>
<p>[no] lldp receive: An interface subcommand that defines the operation of LLDP on the interface regardless of the global [no] lldp run command. The lldp receive interface subcommand causes the device to process received LLDP messages, while no lldp receive causes it to not process received LLDP messages.</p>

<p>like CDP, LLDP uses a send timer and hold timer for the same purposes as CDP. The example shows the default settings of 30 seconds for the send timer and 120 seconds for the hold timer. You can override the defaults with the lldp timer seconds and lldp holdtime seconds global commands</p>

<h1 id="dhcp-configuration">DHCP Configuration</h1>

<p>1.0 Network Fundamentals</p>
<p>1.10 Identify IP parameters for Client OS (Windows, Mac OS, Linux)</p>
<p>4.0 IP Services</p>
<p>4.3 Explain the role of DHCP and DNS within the network</p>
<p>4.6 Configure and verify DHCP client and relay</p>
<p>DHCP Concepts</p>
<p>Four messages between the client and server (DORA):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Discover:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sent by the DHCP client to find a willing DHCP server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sent by a DHCP server to offer to lease</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Request:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sent by the DHCP client to ask the server to lease the IPv4 address listed in the Offer message</li>
</ul>
<p>Acknowledgment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sent by the DHCP server to assign the address and to list the mask, default router, and DNS server IP addresses</li>
</ul>
<p>IPv4 addresses that allow a host that has no IP address to still be able to send and receive messages on the local subnet:</p>
<p>0.0.0.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>An address reserved for use as a source IPv4 address for hosts that do not yet have an IP address.</li>
</ul>
<p>255.255.255.255:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The local broadcast IP address. Packets sent to this destination address are broadcast on the local data link, but routers do not forward them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a client, sends a Discover message, with source IP address of 0.0.0.0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Host A sends the packet to destination 255.255.255.255 router R1 will not forward this packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>assuming the DHCP client chooses to use a DHCP option called the broadcast flag;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all examples in this book assume the broadcast flag is used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all hosts in the subnet receive the Offer message</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the original Discover message lists a number called the client ID, which</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>includes the host’s MAC address, that identifies the original host (host A in this case).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result, host A knows that the Offer message is meant for host A.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Supporting DHCP for Remote Subnets with DHCP Relay</p>
<p>ip helper-address server-ip</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Watch for incoming DHCP messages, with destination IP address 255.255.255.255.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change that packet’s source IP address to the router’s incoming interface IP address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change that packet’s destination IP address to the address of the DHCP server (as configured in the ip helper-address command).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Route the packet to the DHCP server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for the return packet from the DHCP server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the server simply reverses the source and destination IP address of the packet received from the router (relay agent)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Discover message lists source IP address 172.16.1.1, so the server sends the Offer message back to destination IP address 172.16.1.1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the DHCP relay agent (router R1) needs to change the destination IP address, so that the real DHCP client (host A), which does not have an IP address yet, can receive and process the packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sends as broadcast back to the LAN</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Information Stored at the DHCP Server</p>
<p>types of settings the DHCP server needs to know to support DHCP clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Subnet ID and mask:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reserved (excluded) addresses:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which addresses in the subnet to not lease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Default router(s)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DNS IP address(es)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>other parameters</p>
<p>Maximum lease time</p>
<ul>
<li>time limit for leasing an IP address</li>
</ul>
<p>DHCP uses three allocation modes</p>
<p>Dynamic allocation</p>
<ul>
<li>the DHCP mechanisms and configuration described throughout this chapter.</li>
</ul>
<p>automatic allocation</p>
<ul>
<li>sets the DHCP lease time to infinite.</li>
</ul>
<p>static allocation</p>
<ul>
<li>preconfigures the specific IP address for a client based on the client’s MAC address.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server address</p>
<p>Configuring DHCP Relay</p>
<p>What for?</p>
<ul>
<li>DHCP clients exist in the subnet</li>
<li>DHCP servers do not exist in the subnet</li>
</ul>
<p>(config-if)# ip helper-address address</p>
<p>Show ip interface g0/0</p>
<ul>
<li>Helper Address is address or Helper address is not set</li>
</ul>
<p>Configuring a Switch as DHCP Client</p>
<p>(config-if) ip address dhcp</p>
<ul>
<li>the switch does not attempt DHCP until the interface reaches an up/up state</li>
</ul>
<p>show interfaces interface</p>
<ul>
<li>verify ip address</li>
</ul>
<p>show dhcp lease</p>
<ul>
<li>see the (temporarily) leased IP address and other parameters</li>
<li>the switch does not store the DHCP-learned IP configuration in the running-config</li>
</ul>
<p>show ip default-gateway</p>
<ul>
<li>view address of the default gateway</li>
</ul>
<p>Configuring a Router as DHCP Client</p>
<p>(config-if) # ip address dhcp</p>
<ul>
<li>IOS displays this route as a static route (destination 0.0.0.0/0)</li>
</ul>
<p>To recognize this route as a DHCP-learned default route, look to the administrative distance value of 254.</p>
<ul>
<li>administrative distance of 1 for static routes configured with the ip route configuration command</li>
<li>default of 254 for default routes added because of DHCP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Host Settings for IPv4</p>
<p>To work correctly, an IPv4 host needs to know these values:</p>
<ul>
<li>DNS server IP addresses</li>
<li>Default gateway (router) IP address</li>
<li>Device’s own IP address</li>
<li>Device’s own subnet mask</li>
</ul>
<p>Host IP Settings on Windows</p>
<p>netstat -rn</p>
<ul>
<li>lists the host’s IP routing table</li>
<li>the top of the table lists a route based on the default gateway (0.0.0.0 and 0.0.0.0)</li>
<li>top of the output also lists several other routes related to having a working interface, like a route to the subnet connected to the interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>gateway of “on-link”</p>
<p>the PC thinks the destination is on the local subnet (link)</p>
<p>Host IP Settings on macOS</p>
<p>ifconfig</p>
<ul>
<li>does not have an /all option</li>
<li>does not list the default gateway or DNS servers</li>
<li>Shows mac address and ip address</li>
</ul>
<p>networksetup -getinfo Ethernet</p>
<ul>
<li>Shows dhcp config, ip, subnet mask, and default gateway</li>
</ul>
<p>networksetup -getdnsservers Ethernet</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shows dns server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adds a default route to its host routing table based on the default gateway</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adds route to the local subnet calculated based on the IP address and mask learned with DHCP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>uses the netstat -rn command to list those routes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>output represents the default route using the word default rather than 0.0.0.0 and 0.0.0.0</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Host IP Settings on Linux</p>
<p>some Linux distributions do not include net-tools.</p>
<p>You can add net-tools to most Linux distributions.</p>
<p>includes ifconfig and netstat -rn.</p>
<p>iproute library</p>
<ul>
<li>preinstalled on Linux</li>
<li>includes a set of replacement commands and functions, many performed with the ip command and some parameters.</li>
<li>similar to the macOS version but also shows some interface counters.</li>
</ul>
<p>ipaddress</p>
<ul>
<li>shows basic addressing info</li>
<li>Shows subnet in prefix notation rather than in dotted decimal</li>
</ul>
<p>ifconfig wlan0</p>
<ul>
<li>shows l2 and l3 addresses</li>
<li>from net-tools</li>
</ul>
<p>netstat -rn</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>from net-tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lists a default route, but with a style that shows the destination as 0.0.0.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>points to the default gateway as learned with DHCP:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lists a route to the local subnet</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The bottom of the example shows the command meant to replace netstat -rn: ip route. Note that it also shows a default route that references the default router, along with a route for the local subnet.</p>

<h1 id="dhcp-snooping-and-arp-inspection">DHCP Snooping and ARP Inspection</h1>

<p>5.0 Security Fundamentals</p>
<p>5.7 Configure Layer 2 security features (DHCP snooping, dynamic ARP inspection, and port security)</p>
<p>DHCP Snooping</p>
<ul>
<li>notices DHCP messages that fall outside the normal use of DHCP</li>
<li>watches the DHCP messages that flow through a LAN switch</li>
<li>builds a table that lists the details of legitimate DHCP flows</li>
<li>other switch features can know what legitimate DHCP leases exist for devices connected to the switch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>helps prevent packets being redirected to an attacking host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some ARP attacks try to convince hosts to send packets to the attacker’s device instead of the true destination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The switch watches ARP messages as they flow through the switch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>checks incoming ARP messages,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>checks those against normal ARP operation as well as</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>checks the details against other data sources, including the DHCP Snooping binding table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the ARP message does not match the known information about the legitimate addresses in the network, the switch filters the ARP message.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DHCP Snooping Concepts</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>analyzes incoming messages on the specified subset of ports in a VLAN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>never filters non-DHCP messages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allow the incoming DHCP message or discard the message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>operates on LAN switches and is commonly used on Layer 2 LAN switches and enabled on Layer 2 ports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client facing devices are untrusted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DHCP facing devices (server, router, switch) are trusted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>works first on all ports in a VLAN, but with each port being trusted or untrusted by DHCP Snooping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the rules differentiate between messages normally sent by servers (like DHCPOFFER and DHCPACK) versus those normally sent by DHCP clients:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DHCP messages received on an untrusted port, for messages normally sent by a server, will always be discarded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DHCP messages received on an untrusted port, as normally sent by a DHCP client, may be filtered if they appear to be part of an attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DHCP messages received on a trusted port will be forwarded; trusted ports do not filter (discard) any DHCP messages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A Sample Attack: A Spurious DHCP Server</p>
<ul>
<li>Spurious DHCP server (attacker) responds to dhcp message by a client pc</li>
<li>attacker replies with false dhcp information by naming itself as the default gateway</li>
<li>Pc1 send all messages to another network to attacker, becoming a man-in-the-middle attack (pc2 could forward the messages to the actual default gateway</li>
<li>the legitimate DHCP also returns a DHCPOFFER message to host PC1, but most hosts use the first received DHCPOFFER, and the attacker will likely be first in this scenario.</li>
</ul>
<p>DHCP Snooping Logic</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>stops attacks by making ports untrusted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DHCP clients also use the DHCP RELEASE and DHCP DECLINE messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DHCP RELEASE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>client can tell the DHCP server it no longer needs the address, releasing it back to the DHCP server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DHCP DECLINE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>turn down the use of an IP address during the normal DORA flow on messages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DHCP Snooping rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Examine all incoming DHCP messages.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>check for MAC address consistency between the Ethernet frame and the DHCP message.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>RELEASE or DECLINE</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>check the incoming interface plus IP address versus the DHCP Snooping binding table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For messages not filtered that result in a DHCP lease, build a new entry to the DHCP Snooping binding table.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>DHCP Snooping checks to make sure those values match.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>DHCP Snooping, and other features like Dynamic ARP Inspection, can use the table to make decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DHCP Snooping Binding Table:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MAC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VLAN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>INTERFACE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>checks client-sent messages like RELEASE and DECLINE that would cause the DHCP server to be allowed to release an address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>attacker could RELEASE an address that is not his and attempt steal it for himself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>attacker pretends his source IP is the legitimate IP trying to RELEASE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the source interface in the DHCP Snooping Binding Table does not match so dhcp snooping bloacks the request</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DHCP Snooping Configuration</p>
<p>Required:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>enable DHCP Snooping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ip dhcp snooping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>list the VLANs on which to use DHCP Snooping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ip dhcp snooping vlan vlan-id</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Often used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>configure trusted ports</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>default is untrusted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(config-if) # ip dhcp snooping trust</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DHCP Snooping verification</p>
<p>show ip dhcp snooping</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>enabled or disabled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>operational in which vlans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trusted interfaces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insertion of option 82 is disabled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(enabled by default)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no ip dhcp information option command is configured</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(because this switch is not a dhcp relay agent)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DHCP relay agents add option 82 DHCP header fields (RFC 3046)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If enabled on a non relay agent then dhcp stops working for end users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The switch sets fields in the DHCP messages as if it were a DHCP relay agent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>changes to those messages cause most DHCP servers (and most DHCP relay agents) to ignore the received DHCP messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rate limit on each interface</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Show ip dhcp snooping binding</p>
<p>Shows actual dhcp snooping binding table</p>
<p>DHCP Rate Limiting</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>attacker generates large volumes of DHCP messages to overload the DHCP Snooping feature and the switch CPU itself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>optional feature that tracks the number of incoming DHCP messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the number of incoming DHCP messages exceeds that limit over a one-second period:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>port changes to an err-disabled state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-can be on both on trusted and untrusted interfaces.</p>
<ul>
<li>Default of no rate limit</li>
</ul>
<p>how to enable DHCP Snooping rate limits and err-disabled recovery.</p>
<p>(config-int) # ip dhcp snooping rate limit number</p>
<p>errdisable recovery cause dhcp-rate-limit</p>
<ul>
<li>recover from errdisable if caused by dhcp snooping</li>
</ul>
<p>errdisable recovery interval number</p>
<ul>
<li>seconds to wait before recovering</li>
</ul>
<p>(config-int) # no ip dhcp snooping rate limit</p>
<p>Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>examines incoming ARP messages on untrusted ports to filter those it believes to be part of an attack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>compares incoming ARP messages with two sources of data:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DHCP Snooping binding table</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>configured ARP ACLs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the incoming ARP message does not match the tables in the switch, the switch discards the ARP message.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>DAI Concepts</p>
<p>gratuitous ARP (arp reply)—</p>
<p>triggers hosts to add incorrect ARP entries to their ARP tables.</p>
<p>Review of Normal IP ARP</p>
<p>Both hosts learn the other host’s MAC address with this two-message flow. Not only does PC1 learn R2’s MAC address based on the ARP reply (message 2), but router R2 learns PC1’s IP and MAC address because of the ARP request (message 1).</p>

</ul>
<p>Gratuitous ARP as an Attack Vector</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>when a host changes its MAC address it can send a gratuitous ARP message with these features:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ARP reply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sent without having first received an ARP request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sent to an Ethernet destination broadcast address so that all hosts in the subnet receive the message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>could be part of a man-in-the-middle attack</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>attacker uses gratuitous arp to make replies go back to it instead of original host</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dynamic ARP Inspection Logic</p>
<ul>
<li>Host does not need arp if it doesn&rsquo;t have an IP yet</li>
<li>Once DHCP assigns and IP then ARP is used</li>
<li>for untrusted interfaces DAI confirms an ARP’s correctness based on the DHCP Snooping Binding table</li>
<li>compares origin MAC and IP</li>
<li>if not found on the table, discard the arp</li>
<li>same trusted and untrusted rules as dhcp snooping</li>
</ul>
<p>ARP ACL</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>statically configured</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>list correct pairs of IP and mac addresses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Useful for ip addresses configured statically because they will not be in the dhcp snooping binding table</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DAI can check Ethernet header and arp source and destination messages mac addresses to make sure they match</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DAI can also check Messages with unexpected IP addresses in the two ARP IP address fields</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>does its work in the switch CPU rather than in the switch ASIC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DAI itself can be more susceptible to DoS attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>attacker could generate large numbers of ARP messages, driving up CPU usage in the switch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DAI can avoid these problems through rate limiting the number of ARP messages on a port over time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Configuring ARP Inspection on a Layer 2 Switch</p>
<p>decisions include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose whether to rely on DHCP Snooping, ARP ACLs, or both.</li>
<li>If using DHCP Snooping, configure it and make the correct ports trusted for DHCP Snooping.</li>
<li>Choose the VLAN(s) on which to enable DAI.</li>
<li>Make DAI trusted (rather than the default setting of untrusted) on select ports in those VLANs, typically for the same ports you trusted for DHCP Snooping.</li>
</ul>
<p>ip arp inspection vlan vlan-id</p>
<ul>
<li>enable arp DAI on that vlan</li>
</ul>
<p>(config-if)# ip arp inspection trust</p>
<ul>
<li>dhcp snooping should be enabled or DAI will filter all packets</li>

</ul>
<p>drop ARP packets when the IP addresses in the packets are invalid or when the MAC addresses in the body of the ARP packets do not match the addresses specified in the Ethernet header.</p>
<ul>
<li>For src-mac, check the source MAC address in the Ethernet header against the sender MAC address in the ARP body. This check is performed on both ARP requests and responses. When enabled, packets with different MAC addresses are classified as invalid and are dropped.</li>
<li>For dst-mac, check the destination MAC address in the Ethernet header against the target MAC address in ARP body. This check is performed for ARP responses. When enabled, packets with different MAC addresses are classified as invalid and are dropped.</li>
<li>For ip, check the ARP body for invalid and unexpected IP addresses. Addresses include 0.0.0.0, 255.255.255.255, and all IP multicast addresses. Sender IP addresses are checked in all ARP requests and responses, and target IP addresses are checked only in ARP responses</li>

Global command for extended
numbered access lists. Use a
number between 100 and 199 or
2000 and 2699, inclusive.
A version of the access-list com-
mand with parameters specific
to TCP and/or UDP. &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>enable the ACL using the same ip access-group command used with standard ACLs.</li>
<li>Place extended ACLs as close as possible to the source of the packets that will be filtered.</li>
</ul>
<p>- saves some bandwidth.</p>

<li>
<p>ACL numbers</p>

<p>Extended IP Access Lists: Example 1</p>
<p>(If you were to type eq 80, the config would show eq www.)</p>
<p>#(int) ip access-group 101 in</p>
<p>Named ACLs and ACL Editing</p>
<p>Named IP Access Lists</p>
<ul>
<li>Easier to remember</li>
<li>Uses ACL subcommands instead of global config commands</li>
<li>editing features allow deleting individual lines and inserting new ones</li>
</ul>
<p>Config</p>
<p># ip access-list (standard/ extended) (name)</p>
<p>#(ACLmode) permit 1.1.1.1</p>
<p>#(ACLmode) permit 2.2.2.2</p>
<p>#(ACLmode) permit 3.3.3.3</p>
<p>#(ACLmode) deny ip 10.1.2.0 0.0.0.255 10.2.3.0 0.0.0.255</p>
<p>#(int) ip access-group barney out</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>delete and add new lines to the ACL from within ACL configuration mode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deleting a single entry from the ACL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>#(ACLmode) no deny ip 10.1.2.0 0.0.0.255</p>
<p>Editing ACLs Using Sequence Numbers (named and numbered (not the global numbered way)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ACL sequence number is added to each ACL permit or deny statement,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>numbers represent the sequence of statements in the ACL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numbered ACLs can use a configuration style like named ACLs, as well as the traditional style, for the same ACL; the new style is required to perform advanced ACL editing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deleting single lines:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>delete an ACE with a no sequence-number subcommand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inserting new lines:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New ACEs can be configured with a sequence number before the deny or permit command, dictating the location of the statement within the ACL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatic sequence numbering:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sequence numbers are added to ACEs automatically</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p># Show ip access-lists 24</p>
<ul>
<li>Shows access list 24 and sequence numbers with each entry</li>
</ul>
<p>#(ACLmode) no 20</p>
<ul>
<li>delete entry 20</li>
</ul>
<p>#(ACLmode) 5 deny 10.1.1.1</p>
<ul>
<li>enters this new ace as sequence #5</li>
<li>Places the sequence number in the list in order</li>
</ul>
<p>although Example 3-6 uses a numbered ACL, named ACLs use the same process to edit (add and remove) entries.</p>
<p>Numbered ACL Configuration Versus Named ACL Configuration</p>
<ul>
<li>numbered ACLs are stored with the original style of configuration, as global access-list commands, no matter which method is used to configure the ACL.</li>
<li>the parts of ACL 24 configured with both new-style commands and old-style commands are all listed in the same old-style ACL (show running-config).</li>
</ul>
<p>ACL Implementation Considerations</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Place more specific statements early in the ACL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disable an ACL from its interface (using the no ip access-group interface subcommand) before making changes to the ACL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By doing so, you avoid issues with the ACL during an interim state</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mitigating Security Issues with ACLs</p>
<p>Security threats that can be mitigated with ACLs</p>
<p>- IP address spoofing, inbound</p>
<p>- IP address spoofing, outbound</p>
<p>- DoS TCP SYN attacks, blocking external attacks</p>
<p>- Dos TCP SYN attacks, using TCP Intercept</p>
<p>- DoS smurf attacks</p>
<p>- Denying/filtering ICMP messages, inbound</p>
<p>- Denying/filtering ICCMP messages, outbound</p>
<p>- Denying/filtering Traceroute</p>
<p>* Don&rsquo;t allow external packets that have an internal destination address.</p>
<p>Configuring ACLs from the internet</p>
<ul>
<li>Deny any source addresses from your internal networks</li>
</ul>
<p>- Deny any local host addresses (127.0.0.0/8)</p>
<p>- Deny any reserved private addresses (RFC 1918)</p>
<p>- Deny any addresses in the IP multicast address range (224.0.0.0/4)</p>
<p>Controlling VTY (Telnet/ SSH) Access</p>
<p>1. Create a standard IP access list that permits only the host or hosts you want to be able to telnet into the routers.</p>
<p>2. Apply the access list to the VTY line with the access-class in command.</p>
<p>(g) # access-list 50 permit host 172.16.10.3</p>
<p>(g) # line vty  0 4</p>
<p>(int) # access-class 50 in</p>
<p>Monitoring Access Lists</p>
<p># show access-list</p>
<p>shows access lists, parameters, statistics, etc.</p>
<p># show access-list 110</p>
<p>Shows info for access list 110</p>
<p># show ip access-list</p>
<p>shows IP access lists on the router</p>
<p># show ip interface</p>
<p>Shows which interfaces have access lists set on them.</p>
<p># show running-config</p>
<p>Shows ACLs and what interfaces that have them.</p>

<p>It took me a whopping 2 years to finish my CCNA! I kept giving up and quitting my studies for months at a time. Why? Because I couldn&rsquo;t remember the massive amount of content covered in the CCNA. It felt hopeless. I could have done it in 6 month (or faster) if I knew how to study.</p>
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t taken a test in 10 years before this. So I had completely forgotten how to learn. This post is about the mistakes I made studying for the CCNA and how to avoid them.</p>
<p>You will also learn, as I did, about spaced repetition. I&rsquo;ve also included a 6 month CCNA spaced repetition calendar.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="my-mistakes-so-you-dont-make-them">My Mistakes, So You Don&rsquo;t Make Them</h2>
<hr>
<h3 id="mistake-1-didnt-start-flashcards-until-the-final-30-days">Mistake #1 Didn&rsquo;t start flashcards until the final 30 days</h3>
<p>I wish I would have started flashcards from day 1. This would have helped a crap ton. Remembering all of the little details is not only useful for taking the test. It embeds the concepts in your brain and keeps you processing how things work .</p>
<p>If there is anything you take from this list. You should definitely be doing some flashcards every day.</p>
<h3 id="mistake-2-not-enough-labs-as-i-went">Mistake #2 Not enough labs as I went.</h3>
<p>While studying the OCG and video courses. I did some labs. But I also skipped a ton of labs because it wasn&rsquo;t convenient at the time. Then I was forced to lab every single topic in the final 30 days. A lot of cramming was done..</p>
<p>Make sure to do all of the labs as you go. Make up your own labs as well. This is very important to building job worthy skills.</p>
<h3 id="mistake-3-didnt-have-a-plan-or-stick-with-it">Mistake #3 Didn&rsquo;t have a plan or stick with it.</h3>
<p>When your plan consists of, &ldquo;just read everything and watch the videos and take the test when you feel ready&rdquo;, you tend to procrastinate and put things off. Make a study schedule and a solid plan. (See below)</p>
<p>Having a set date for when you will take the test was pretty motivating. I did not find this out until about 30 days until my test.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced Repetition</h2>
<hr>
<p>If you are using Anki flashcards for your studies, you may already be using spaced repetition. Spaced repetition is repeatedly reviewing with the time in between reviews getting longer each time you review it.</p>
<p>Here is an excellent article about our learning curves and why spaced repetition helps us remember things <a href="https://fs.blog/spacing-effect/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="https://fs.blog/spacing-effect/">https://fs.blog/spacing-effect/</a></p>
<h4 id="how-to-set-up-a-spaced-repetition-calendar-for-ccna">How to set up a spaced repetition calendar for CCNA.</h4>
<p>Step 1. Plan how long your studies will take</p>
<p>Figure out how long you need. It usually takes around 240 hours of studying for CCNA. (Depending on experience). Then figure out how many hours per day that you can spend on studying. This example is based on a 6 month study calendar.</p>
<p>You can use this 6 month excel calendar to plan and track your progress. You. can still use this method If you have already been studying CCNA. Just edit your calendar for how much time you have left.</p>
<p>The calendar is also based on Wendel Odom&rsquo;s Official Cert Guide. You will also want to mix your other resources into your reviews.</p>
<p>Decide what your review sessions will be</p>
<p>Plan to review each chapter 3-4 times. here is what I did for review sessions to pass the exam.</p>
<p>Review 1 Read and highlight (and flashcards)</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the chapter. Highlight key information that you want to remember.</li>
<li>Do a lab for the material you studied (if applicable)</li>
<li>Answer DIKTA questions</li>
<li>Start Chapter 1 Anki Flascards</li>
</ul>
<p>Review 2 Copy highlights over to OneNote (keep doing flashcards)</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy your highlights over to OneNote. (using copy and paste if you have the digital book)</li>
<li>Read your highlights and make sure you understand everything.</li>
<li>lab and continue doing flashcards. (just go through Anki suggested flashcards, not just ones for the specific chapter.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Review 3 Labs and Highlight your notes (and flashcards)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More labs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go over your notes. Color coding everything. (You can find my jumbled note mess here)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Green: Read again</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teal: Very important Learn this/ lab it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red/ purple: make extra flashcards out of this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Review 4 Practice questions and review</p>
<ul>
<li>Go through and answer the DIKTA questions again. Review any missed answers.</li>
<li>Lab anything you aren&rsquo;t quite sure of.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final 30 days</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-a5874a1cbcc918ddf0085bb147495a9f" class="lightbox-link"><img class="noborder lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/Pasted%20image%2020231208132727.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-a5874a1cbcc918ddf0085bb147495a9f"><img class="noborder lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/Pasted%20image%2020231208132727.png"></a></p>
<p>I HIGHLY recommend Boson ExSim for your final 30 days of studying. ExSim comes with 3 exams (A,B, and C). Start with exam A in test simulation mode. Leave about a week in between each practice exam so you can go over your answers and Boson&rsquo;s explanations for each answer.</p>
<p>One week before your test, (after you&rsquo;ve completed exams A,B, and C). Do a random exam. Make sure you do the timed version that don&rsquo;t show your score as you go.</p>
<p>You should be scoring above 900 by your 3rd and 4th exam if you have been reviewing Boson&rsquo;s answer explanations.</p>
<p>Schedule your exam</p>
<p>Pearson view didn&rsquo;t let me schedule the exam past 30 days out from when I wanted to take it. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is the case all the time. But by the time you are 30 days out you should have your test scheduled. This will light the fire under you. Great motivation for the home stretch.</p>
<p>If your exam is around June during Cisco Live, Cisco usually offers a 50% discount for an exam voucher. You probably won’t find any other discounts unless you pay for Cisco’s specific CCNA training.</p>
<h2 id="final-word-on-labs">Final word on labs</h2>
<p>You can technically pass the CCNA without doing many labs. But this will leave you at a HUGE disadvantage in the job market. Labs are crucial for really understanding networking. Knowing your way around the CLI and being able to troubleshoot networking issues will make you stand out from those who crammed for the exam.</p>
<p>If you’ve made it this far I really appreciate you taking the time to read this post. I really hope it helps at least one person.</p>

Figure 124 Balancing Traffic by Assigning Different Default Routers to Different Clients &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>All hosts act like they always have, with one default router setting that never has to change.</p>
<p>The default routers share a virtual IP address in the subnet, defined by the FHRP.</p>
<p>Hosts use the FHRP virtual IP address as their default router address.</p>
<p>The routers exchange FHRP protocol messages so that both agree as to which router does what work at any point in time.</p>
<p>When a router fails or has some other problem, the routers use the FHRP to choose which router takes over responsibilities from the failed router.</p>

<p>To make the switches change their MAC address table entries for VMAC1, R2 sends an Ethernet frame with VMAC1 as the source MAC address.</p>
<p>he frame is also a LAN broadcast, so all the switches learn a MAC table entry for VMAC1 that leads toward R2.</p>
<p>HSRP Load Balancing</p>
<p>you can configure multiple instances of HSRP in the same subnet (called multiple HSRP groups), preferring one router to be active in one group and the other router to be preferred as active in another.</p>

<p>keeps a database of variables that make up the parameters, status, and counters for the operations of the device. This database, called the Management Information Base (MIB)</p>
<p>IOS on routers and switches include an SNMP agent, with built-in MIB, that can be enabled with the configuration shown later</p>

<p>SNMP Variable Reading and Writing: SNMP Get and Set</p>
<p>NMS typically polls the SNMP agent on each device</p>
<p>NMS can notify the human user in front of the PC or send emails, texts, and so on to notify the network operations staff of any issues identified by the data found by polling the devices. You can even reconfigure the device through these SNMP variables in the MIB if you permit this level of control.</p>
<p>NMS uses the SNMP Get, GetNext, and GetBulk messages (together referenced simply as Get messages) to ask for information from an agent.</p>
<p>NMS sends an SNMP Set message to write variables on the SNMP agent as a means to change the configuration of the device.</p>
<p>messages come in pairs, with, for instance, a Get Request asking the agent for the contents of a variable, and the Get Response supplying that information</p>

<p>NMS can analyze various statistical facts such as averages, minimums, and maximums</p>
<p>NMS can set thresholds for certain key variables, telling the NMS to send a notification (email, text, and so on) when a threshold is passed.</p>
<p>SNMP Notifications: Traps and Informs</p>
<p>SNMP agents can initiate communications to the NMS.</p>
<p>generally called notifications, use two specific SNMP messages: Trap and Inform</p>
<p>SNMP agents send a Trap or Inform SNMP message to the NMS to list the state of certain MIB variables when those variables reach a certain state.</p>

<p>SNMP Traps and Inform messages have the exact same purpose but differ in the protocol mechanisms</p>
<p>trap</p>
<p>The SNMP agent sends the Trap to the IP address of the NMS, with UDP as the transport protocol as with all SNMP messages,</p>
<p>less overhead than inform</p>
<p>Inform</p>
<p>Like Trap messages but with reliability added</p>
<p>Added to the protocol with SNMP Version 2 (SNMPv2),</p>
<p>use UDP but add application layer reliability</p>
<p>NMS must acknowledge receipt of the Inform with an SNMP Response message, or the SNMP agent will time out and resend the Inform.</p>
<p>The Management Information Base</p>
<p>Every SNMP agent has its own Management Information Base</p>
<p>defines variables whose values are set and updated by the agent</p>
<p>enable the management software to monitor/control the network device.</p>
<p>defines each variable as an object ID (OID)</p>
<p>organizes the OIDs based in part on RFC standards, and in part with vendor-proprietary variables</p>
<p>organizes all the variables into a hierarchy of OIDs, usually shown as a tree</p>
<p>Each node in the tree can be described based on the tree structure sequence, either by name or by number.</p>

<p>Securing SNMP</p>
<p>use ACLs to limit SNMP messages to those from known servers only.</p>
<p>can configure an IPv4 ACL to filter incoming SNMP messages that arrive in IPv4 packets and an IPv6 ACL to filter SNMP messages that arrive in IPv6 packets.</p>
<p>all versions of SNMP support a basic clear-text password mechanism,</p>
<p>SNMPv1 defined clear-text passwords called SNMP communities.</p>
<p>SNMP agent and the SNMP manager need prior knowledge of the same SNMP community value (called a community string)</p>
<p>Get messages and the Set message include the appropriate community string value, in clear text.</p>
<p>NMS sends a Get or Set with the correct community string, as configured on the SNMP agent, the agent processes the message.</p>
<p>SNMPv1 defines both a read-only community and a read-write community.</p>
<p>read-only (RO) community allows Get messages, and the read-write (RW) community allows both reads and writes (Gets and Sets).</p>

<p>The original specifications for SNMPv2 did not include SNMPv1 communities</p>

<p>security had arrived with the powerful network management protocol. SNMPv3 does away with communities and replaces them with the following features:</p>
<p>Message integrity: This mechanism, applied to all SNMPv3 messages, confirms whether or not each message has been changed during transit.</p>
<p>Authentication: This optional feature adds authentication with both a username and password, with the password never sent as clear text. Instead, it uses a hashing method like many other modern authentication processes.</p>
<p>Encryption (privacy): This optional feature encrypts the contents of SNMPv3 messages so that attackers who intercept the messages cannot read their contents.</p>

<h3 id="upgrading-ios-images">Upgrading IOS Images</h3>
<p>process to upgrade an IOS image into flash memory, using the following steps:</p>
<p>Step 1. Obtain the IOS image from Cisco, usually by downloading the IOS image from Cisco.com using HTTP or FTP.</p>
<p>Step 2. Place the IOS image someplace that the router can reach. Locations include TFTP or FTP servers in the network or a USB flash drive that is then inserted into the router.</p>
<p>Step 3. Issue the copy command from the router, copying the file into the flash memory that usually remains with the router on a permanent basis. (Routers usually cannot boot from the IOS image in a USB flash drive.)</p>

<p>The FTP and TFTP Protocols</p>
<p>copy command, when using the tftp or ftp keyword, makes the command act as a client</p>
<p>FTP Protocol Basics</p>
<p>uses TCP</p>
<p>TCP port 21 and in some cases also well-known port 20.</p>
<p>FTP uses a client/server model for file transfer</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>FTP control connection—define the kinds of functions supported by FTP</p>
<p>allow the client to navigate around the directory structures of the server, list files, and then transfer files from the server (FTP GET) or to the server (FTP PUT).</p>
<p>summary of some of the FTP actions:</p>
<p>Navigate directories: List the current directory, change the current directory to a new directory, go back to the home directory, all on both the server and client side of the connection.</p>
<p>Add/remove directories: Create new directories and remove existing directories on both the client and server.</p>
<p>List files: List files on both the client and server.</p>
<p>File transfer: Get (client gets a copy of the file from the server), Put (client takes a file that exists on the client and puts a copy of the FTP server).</p>
<p>FTP Active and Passive Modes</p>
<p>may impact whether the TCP client can or cannot connect to the server and perform normal functions</p>
<p>user at the FTP client can choose which mode to use</p>
<p>FTP passive mode may be the more likely option to work.</p>
<p>FTP uses two types of TCP connections:</p>
<p>Control Connection: Used to exchange FTP commands</p>
<p>Data Connection: Used for sending and receiving data, both for file transfers and for output to display to a user</p>
<p>when a client connects to an FTP server, the client first creates the FTP control connection</p>
<p>server listens for new control connections on its well-known port 21</p>
<p>client allocates any new dynamic port (49222 in this case) and creates a TCP connection to the server</p>

<p>The FTP client allocates a currently unused dynamic port and starts listening on that port.</p>
<p>The client identifies that port (and its IP address) to the FTP server by sending an FTP PORT command to the server.</p>
<p>The server, because it also operates in active mode, expects the PORT command; the server reacts and initiates the FTP data connection to the client’s address (192.168.1.102) and port (49333).</p>

<p>SFTP</p>
<p>uses SSH to encrypt file transfers over an SSH connection. However, the acronym SFTP does not refer to a secure version of FTP.</p>
<p>TFTP Protocol Basics</p>
<p>Trivial File Transfer Protocol uses UDP well-known port 69. Because it uses UDP, TFTP adds a feature to check each file for transmission errors by using a checksum process on each file after the transfer completes.</p>
<p>the code requires less space to install, which can be useful for devices with limited memory.</p>

<h1 id="ipv6-addressing-and-subnetting">IPv6 Addressing and Subnetting</h1>

<p>This chapter covers the following exam topics:</p>
<p>1.0 Network Fundamentals</p>
<p>1.8 Configure and verify IPv6 addressing and prefix</p>
<p>1.9 Compare and contrast IPv6 address types</p>
<p>1.9.a Global unicast</p>
<p>1.9.b Unique local</p>
<p>IPv6 does not use any concept like the classful network concept used by IPv4. However, IANA does still reserve some IPv6 address ranges for specific purposes.</p>
<p>Public and Private IPv6 Addresses</p>
<p>global unicast addresses as the public IPv6 address space.</p>
<p>Global unicast: Addresses that work like public IPv4 addresses. The organization that needs IPv6 addresses asks for a registered IPv6 address block, which is assigned as a global routing prefix. After that, only that organization uses the addresses inside that block of addresses—that is, the addresses that begin with the assigned prefix.</p>
<p>Unique local: Works somewhat like private IPv4 addresses, with the possibility that multiple organizations use the exact same addresses, and with no requirement for registering with any numbering authority.</p>
<p>That reserved block of IPv6 addresses—a set of addresses that only one company can use—is called a global routing prefix.</p>
<p>Address Ranges for Global Unicast Addresses</p>
<p>unique local unicast addresses, discussed later in this chapter, all start with hex FD.</p>
<p>any address ranges that are not specifically reserved, for now, are considered to be global unicast addresses.</p>
<p>ddress Type
Global unicast
Unique local

First Hex Digits
2 or 3 (originally); all not otherwise reserved (today)
FE80 &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>IPv6 Subnetting Using Global Unicast Addresses</p>
<p>Most everyone uses the easiest possible IPv6 prefix length: /64.</p>
<p>the right side of the IPv6, formally called the interface ID (short for interface identifier), acts like the IPv4 host field.</p>
<p>the prefix length of the global routing prefix is often between /32 and /48, or possibly as long as /56.</p>
<p>with the commonly used 64-bit interface ID field, the subnet field is typically 64–P bits, with P being the length of the global routing prefix.</p>
<p>All subnet IDs begin with the global routing prefix.</p>
<p>Use a different value in the subnet field to identify each different subnet.</p>
<p>All subnet IDs have all 0s in the interface ID.</p>
<p>The IPv6 subnet ID, more formally called the subnet router anycast address, is reserved and should not be used as an IPv6 address for any host.</p>
<p>Assigning Addresses to Hosts in a Subnet</p>
<p>hosts can learn these same settings dynamically, using either Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or a built-in IPv6 mechanism called Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).</p>
<p>Unique Local Unicast Addresses</p>
<p>Unique local unicast addresses act as private IPv6 addresses.</p>
<p>The biggest difference lies in the literal number (unique local addresses begin with hex FD) and with the administrative process: the unique local prefixes are not registered with any numbering authority and can be used by multiple organizations.</p>
<p>Use FD as the first two hex digits.</p>
<p>Choose a unique 40-bit global ID.</p>
<p>Append the global ID to FD to create a 48-bit prefix, used as the prefix for all your addresses.</p>
<p>Use the next 16 bits as a subnet field.</p>
<p>Note that the structure leaves a convenient 64-bit interface ID field.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>IANA actually reserves prefix FC00::/7, and not FD00::/8, for these addresses. FC00::/7 includes all addresses that begin with hex FC and FD. However, an RFC (4193) requires the eighth bit of these addresses to be set to 1, which means that in practice today, the unique local addresses all begin with their first two digits as FD.</p>
<p>Subnetting with Unique Local IPv6 Addresses</p>
<p>With unique local, you create that prefix locally, and the prefix begins with /48, with the first 8 bits set and the next 40 bits randomly chosen.</p>
<p>imagine you chose a 10-hex-digit value of hex 00 0001 0001, prepend a hex FD, making the entire prefix be FD00:0001:0001::/48, or FD00:1:1::/48 when abbreviated.</p>
<p>The Need for Globally Unique Local Addresses</p>
<p>RFC stresses the importance of choosing your global ID in a way to make it statistically unlikely to be used by other companies.</p>
<p>in a real network, plan on using the random number generator logic listed in RFC 4193 to create your prefix.</p>
<p>One of the big reasons to attempt to use a unique prefix, rather than everyone using the same easy-to-remember prefixes, is to be ready for the day that your company merges with or buys another company.</p>
<p>With IPv6 unique local addresses, if both companies did the right thing and randomly chose a prefix, they will most likely be using completely different prefixes, making the merger much simpler</p>

<p>IPv6 Routing</p>
<p>To be able to build and send IPv6 packets out an interface, end-user devices need an IPv6 address on that interface.</p>
<p>End-user hosts need to know the IPv6 address of a default router, to which the host sends IPv6 packets if the host is in a different subnet.</p>
<p>IPv6 routers de-encapsulate and re-encapsulate each IPv6 packet when routing the packet.</p>
<p>IPv6 routers make routing decisions by comparing the IPv6 packet’s destination address to the router’s IPv6 routing table; the matched route lists directions of where to send the IPv6 packet next.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>You could take the preceding list and replace every instance of IPv6 with IPv4, and all the statements would be true of IPv4 as well.</p>
<p>the router must look at a protocol type field in the data-link header, which identifies the type of packet inside the data-link frame. Today, most data-link frames carry either an IPv4 packet or an IPv6 packet.</p>
<p>To route an IPv6 packet, a router must use its IPv6 routing table instead of the IPv4 routing table.</p>
<p>the process works like IPv4, except that the IPv6 packet lists IPv6 addresses, and the IPv6 routing table lists routing information for IPv6 subnets (called prefixes).</p>
<p>(The migration strategy of running both IPv4 and IPv6 is called dual stack.) All you have to do is configure the router to route IPv6 packets, in addition to the existing configuration for routing IPv4 packets.</p>
<p>IPv6 Routing Protocols</p>
<p>Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) were all updated to support IPv6.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>these routing protocols also follow the same interior gateway protocol (IGP) and exterior gateway protocol (EGP) conventions as their IPv4 cousins. RIPng, EIGRPv6, and OSPFv3 act as interior gateway protocols, advertising IPv6 routes inside an enterprise.</p>
<p>Representing the Prefix Length of an Address</p>
<p>IPv6 uses a mask concept, called the prefix length, similar to IPv4 subnet masks.</p>
<p>the IPv6 prefix length is written as a /, followed by a decimal number. The prefix length defines how many bits of the IPv6 address define the IPv6 prefix, which is basically the same concept as the IPv4 subnet ID.</p>
<p>When writing an IPv6 address and prefix length in documentation, you can choose to leave a space before the /, or not, as shown in the next two examples.</p>
<p>2222:1111:0:1:A:B:C:D/64</p>
<p>2222:1111:0:1:A:B:C:D /64</p>
<p>Finding the IPv6 Prefix</p>
<p>by zeroing out the last 64 bits (16 digits) of the address, you find the following prefix value:</p>
<p>2000:1234:5678:9ABC:0000:0000:0000:0000/64</p>
<p>This value can be abbreviated, with four quartets of all 0s at the end, as follows:</p>
<p>2000:1234:5678:9ABC::/64</p>

<p>Configuring the Full 128-Bit Address</p>
<p>To statically configure the full 128-bit unicast address—either global unicast or unique local—the router needs an ipv6 address address/prefix-length interface subcommand on each interface. The address can be an abbreviated IPv6 address or the full 32-digit hex address. The command includes the prefix length value, at the end, with no space between the address and prefix length.</p>

<p>Enabling IPv6 Routing</p>
<p>IPv6 routing is not enabled by default. The solution takes only a single command—ipv6 unicast-routing—which enables IPv6 routing on the router.</p>
<p>A router must enable IPv6 globally (ipv6 unicast-routing) and enable IPv6 on the interface (ipv6 address) before the router will attempt to route IPv6 packets in and out an interface. If you omit the ipv6 unicast-routing command but configure interface IPv6 addresses, the router will not route any received IPv6 packets, but the router will act as an IPv6 host. If you include the ipv6 unicast-routing command but omit all the interface IPv6 addresses, the router will be ready to route IPv6 packets but have no interfaces that have IPv6 enabled, effectively disabling IPv6 routing</p>
<p>Verifying the IPv6 Address Configuration</p>
<p>The show ipv6 interface brief command gives you interface IPv6 address info, but not prefix length info, similar to the IPv4 show ip interface brief command.</p>
<p>this command lists IPv6 addresses, but not the prefix length or prefixes.</p>
<p>The show ipv6 interface command gives the details of IPv6 interface settings, much like the show ip interface command does for IPv4.</p>
<p>the show interfaces command still lists the IPv4 address and mask but tells us nothing about IPv6. So, to see IPv6 interface addresses, use commands that begin with show ipv6</p>
<p>Generating a Unique Interface ID Using Modified EUI-64</p>
<p>The router then uses EUI-64 rules to create the interface ID part of the address, as follows:</p>
<p>Key Topic.</p>
<p>Split the 6-byte (12-hex-digit) MAC address in two halves (6 hex digits each).</p>
<p>Insert FFFE in between the two, making the interface ID now have a total of 16 hex digits (64 bits).</p>
<p>Invert the seventh bit of the interface ID.</p>

<p>mac-address command under R1’s G0/0 interface, which causes IOS to use the configured MAC address instead of the universal (burned-in) MAC address</p>
<p>for interfaces that do not have a MAC address, like serial interfaces, the router uses the MAC of the lowest-numbered router interface that does have a MAC.</p>
<p>if you mistakenly type the full address and still use the eui-64 keyword, IOS accepts the command and converts the address to the matching prefix before putting the command into the running config file. For example, IOS converts ipv6 address 2000:1:1:1::1/64 eui-64 to ipv6 address 2000:1:1:1::/64 eui-64.</p>
<p>Dynamic Unicast Address Configuration</p>
<p>routers can be configured to use dynamically learned IPv6 addresses. These can be useful for routers connecting to the Internet through some types of Internet access technologies, like DSL and cable modems.</p>
<p>two ways for the router interface to dynamically learn an IPv6 address to use:</p>
<p>Stateful DHCP</p>
<p>Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Special Addresses Used by Routers</p>
<p>After you configure the ipv6 unicast-routing global configuration command, to enable the function of IPv6 routing, the addition of a unicast IPv6 address on an interface causes the router to do the following:</p>
<p>Gives the interface a unicast IPv6 address</p>
<p>Enables the routing of IPv6 packets in/out that interface</p>
<p>Defines the IPv6 prefix (subnet) that exists off that interface</p>
<p>Tells the router to add a connected IPv6 route for that prefix, to the IPv6 routing table, when that interface is up/up</p>
<p>the same ideas happen for IPv4 when you configure an IPv4 address on a router interface.</p>
<p>Link-Local Addresses</p>
<p>a special kind of unicast IPv6 address.</p>
<p>not used for normal IPv6 packet flows that contain data for applications</p>
<p>used by some overhead protocols and for routing.</p>
<p>Link-Local Address Concepts</p>
<p>packets sent to any link-local address should not be forwarded by any router to another subnet.</p>
<p>For example, Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), which replaces the functions of IPv4’s ARP, uses link-local addresses.</p>
<p>Routers also use link-local addresses as the next-hop IP addresses in IPv6 routes,</p>
<p>IPv6 hosts also use a default router (default gateway) concept, like IPv4, but instead of the router address being in the same subnet, hosts refer to the router’s link-local address. The show ipv6 route command lists the link-local address of the neighboring router, rather than the global unicast or unique local unicast address.</p>

<p>key facts about link-local addresse</p>
<p>Unicast (not multicast): Link-local addresses represent a single host,</p>
<p>Forwarding scope is the local link only: Packets sent to a link-local address do not leave the local data link because routers do not forward packets with link-local destination addresses.</p>
<p>Automatically generated: Every IPv6 host interface (and router interface) can create its own link-local address automatically,</p>
<p>Creating Link-Local Addresses on Routers</p>
<p>all link-local addresses start with the same prefix,(FE80,FE90,FEA0,FEB0) as shown on the left side of Figure 24-9.</p>
<p>E80 : 0000 : 0000 : 0000
Figure 24-9 Link-Local Address Format
64 Bits
Interface ID: EUl-64 &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>the first 10 bits must match prefix FE80::/10, meaning that the first three hex digits will be either FE8, FE9, FEA, or FEB.</p>
<p>the next 54 bits should be binary 0, so the link-local address should always start with FE80:0000:0000:0000 as the first four unabbreviated quartets.</p>
<p>The second half of the link-local address, in practice, can be formed using EUI-64 rules, can be randomly generated, or even configured.</p>
<p>IOS creates a link-local address for any interface that has configured at least one other unicast address using the ipv6 address command (global unicast or unique local). To see the link-local address, just use the usual commands that also list the unicast IPv6 address: show ipv6 interface and show ipv6 interface brief.</p>

<p>both addresses have the same interface ID value</p>
<p>IOS chooses the link-local address for the interface based on the following rules:</p>
<p>If configured, the router uses the value in the ipv6 address address link-local interface subcommand. Note that the configured link-local address must be from the correct address range for link-local addresses; that is, an address from prefix FE80::/10. In other words, the address must begin with FE8, FE9, FEA, or FEB.</p>
<p>If not configured, the IOS calculates the link-local address using EUI-64 rules, as discussed and demonstrated in and around Example 24-7. The calculation uses EUI-64 rules even if the interface unicast address does not use EUI-64.</p>
<p>Routing IPv6 with Only Link-Local Addresses on an Interface</p>
<p>ipv6 address address/prefix-length: Static configuration of a specific address</p>
<p>ipv6 address prefix/prefix-length eui-64: Static configuration of a specific prefix and prefix length, with the router calculating the interface ID using EUI-64 rules</p>
<p>ipv6 address dhcp: Dynamic learning on the address and prefix length using DHCP</p>
<p>ipv6 address autoconfig: Dynamic learning of the prefix and prefix length, with the router calculating the interface ID using EUI-64 rules (SLAAC)</p>
<p>ipv6 enable: Enables IPv6 processing and adds a link-local address, but adds no other unicast IPv6 addresses.</p>
<p>some links, particularly WAN links, do not need a global unicast address</p>
<p>the routers do not need to have global unicast (or unique local) addresses on the WAN links for routing to work. IPv6 routing protocols use link-local addresses as the next-hop address when dynamically building IPv6 routes.</p>
<p>static routes, as discussed in Chapter 25, “Implementing IPv6 Routing,” can use link-local addresses for the next-hop address.</p>
<p>creating a WAN link with no global unicast (or unique local) addresses works. As a result, you would not even need to assign an IPv6 subnet to each WAN link. Then to configure the WAN interfaces, use the ipv6 enable command, enabling IPv6 and giving each interface a generated link-local IPv6 address.</p>
<p>To use the command, just configure the ipv6 enable command on the interfaces on both ends of the WAN link.</p>
<p>IPv6 Multicast Addresses</p>
<p>IANA defines the range FF30::/12 (all IPv6 addresses that begin with FF3) as the range of addresses to be used for some types of multicast applications.</p>
<p>different IPv6 RFCs reserve multicast addresses for specific purposes. For instance, OSPFv3 uses FF02::5 and FF02::6 as the all-OSPF-routers and all-DR-Routers multicast addresses,</p>
<p>OSPFv2 uses IPv4 addresses 224.0.0.5 and 224.0.0.6 for the equivalent purposes.</p>
<p>Reserved Multicast Addresses</p>
<p>IPv6, instead of using Layer 3 and Layer 2 broadcasts, instead uses Layer 3 multicast addresses, which in turn cause Ethernet frames to use Ethernet multicast addresses. As a result:</p>
<p>All the hosts that should receive the message receive the message, which is necessary for the protocols to work. However…</p>
<p>…Hosts that do not need to process the message can make that choice with much less processing as compared to IPv4.</p>
<p>OSPFv3 uses IPv6 multicast addresses FF02::5 and FF02::6. In a subnet, the OSPFv3 routers will listen for packets sent to those addresses. However, all the endpoint hosts do not use OSPFv3 and should ignore those OSPFv3 messages</p>

<p>Link-local address: An IPv6 address that begins FE80. This serves as a unicast address for an interface to which devices apply a link-local scope. Devices often create their own link-local addresses using EUI-64 rules. A more complete term for comparison would be link-local unicast address.</p>
<p>Link-local multicast address: An IPv6 address that begins with FF02. This serves as a reserved multicast address to which devices apply a link-local scope.</p>
<p>Link-local scope: A reference to the scope itself, rather than an address. This scope defines that routers should not forward packets sent to an address in this scope.</p>
<p>Solicited-Node Multicast Addresses</p>
<p>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) replaces IPv4 ARP,</p>
<p>NDP improves the MAC-discovery process by sending IPv6 multicast packets that can be processed by the correct host but discarded with less processing by the rest of the hosts in the subnet</p>
<p>Figure 24-12 shows how to determine the solicited node multicast address associated with a unicast address. Start with the predefined /104 prefix (26 hex digits) shown in Figure 24-12. In other words, all the solicited-node multicast addresses begin with the abbreviated FF02::1:FF. In the last 24 bits (6 hex digits), copy the last 6 hex digits of the unicast address into the solicited-node address.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous IPv6 Addresses</p>
<p>all IPv6 hosts can use two additional special addresses:</p>
<p>The unknown (unspecified) IPv6 address, ::, or all 0s</p>
<p>The loopback IPv6 address, ::1, or 127 binary 0s with a single 1</p>
<p>A host can use the unknown address (::) when its own IPv6 address is not yet known or when the host wonders if its own IPv6 address might have problems.</p>
<p>hosts use the unknown address during the early stages of dynamically discovering their IPv6 address. When a host does not yet know what IPv6 address to use, it can use the :: address as its source IPv6 address</p>
<p>IPv6 loopback address gives each IPv6 host a way to test its own protocol stack. Just like the IPv4 127.0.0.1 loopback address, packets sent to ::1 do not leave the host but are instead simply delivered down the stack to IPv6 and back up the stack to the application on the local host</p>
<p>Anycast Addresses</p>
<p>service works best when implemented on several routers</p>
<p>Hosts can send just one packet to an IPv6 address, and the routers will forward the packet to the nearest router that supports that service by virtue of supporting that destination IPv6 address.</p>
<p>Step 1. Two routers configure the exact same IPv6 address, designated as an anycast address, to support some service.</p>
<p>Step 2. In the future, when any router receives a packet for that anycast address, the other routers simply route the packet to the nearest router that supports the address.</p>
<p>the routers implementing the anycast address must be configured and then advertise a route for the anycast address. The addresses do not come from a special reserved range of addresses;</p>
<p>they are from the unicast address range. Often, the address is configured with a /128 prefix so that the routers advertise a host route for that one anycast address.</p>
<p>the routing protocol advertises the route just like any other IPv6 route; the other routers cannot tell the difference</p>
<p>the actual address (2001:1:1:2::99) looks like any other unicast address</p>
<p>note the different anycast keyword on the ipv6 address command, telling the local router that the address has a special purpose as an anycast address</p>
<p>the show ipv6 interface command does identify the address as an anycast address, but the show ipv6 interface brief command does not.</p>

<p>Connected and Local IPv6 Routes</p>
<p>a router adds IPv6 routes based on the following:</p>
<p>The configuration of IPv6 addresses on working interfaces (connected and local routes)</p>
<p>The direct configuration of a static route (static routes)</p>
<p>The configuration of a routing protocol, like OSPFv3, on routers that share the same data link (dynamic routes)</p>
<p>Rules for Connected and Local Routes</p>
<p>First, the router looks for any configured unicast addresses on any interfaces by looking for the ipv6 address command.</p>
<p>if the interface is working—if the interface has a “line status is up, protocol status is up” notice in the output of the show interfaces command—the router adds both a connected and local route.</p>
<p>Routers do not create connected or local IPv6 routes for link-local addresses.</p>
<p>The connected route represents the subnet connected to the interface, whereas the local route is a host route for only the specific IPv6 address configured on the interface.</p>
<p>Routers create IPv6 routes based on each unicast IPv6 address on an interface, as configured with the ipv6 address command, as follows:</p>
<p>The router creates a route for the subnet (a connected route).</p>
<p>The router creates a host route (/128 prefix length) for the router IPv6 address (a local route).</p>
<p>Routers do not create routes based on the link-local addresses associated with the interface.</p>
<p>Routers remove the connected and local routes for an interface if the interface fails, and they re-add these routes when the interface is again in a working (up/up) state</p>

<p>Static IPv6 Routes</p>
<p>static routes require direct configuration with the ipv6 route command</p>
<p>the ipv6 route command begins with the prefix and prefix length. Then the respective commands list the directions of how this router should forward packets toward that destination subnet or prefix by listing the outgoing interface or the address of the next-hop router.</p>
<p>A static route on R1, for this subnet, will begin with ipv6 route 2001:DB8:1111:2::/64, followed by either the outgoing interface (S0/0/0) or the next-hop IPv6 address, or both.</p>

<p>Example Static Route with a Link-Local Next-Hop Address</p>
<p>ipv6 route command cannot simply refer to a link-local next-hop address by itself because the link-local address does not, by itself, tell the local router which outgoing interface to use.</p>
<p>With a link-local next-hop address, a router cannot work through this same logic, so the outgoing interface must also be configured.</p>

<p>Static Routes over Ethernet Links</p>
<p>To configure a static route that uses an Ethernet interface, the ipv6 route command’s forwarding parameters should always include a next-hop IPv6 address. IOS allows you to configure the ipv6 route command using only the outgoing-interface parameter, without listing a next-hop address. The router will accept the command; however, if that outgoing interface happens to be an Ethernet interface, the router cannot successfully forward IPv6 packets using the route.</p>
<p>To configure the ipv6 route correctly when directing packets out an Ethernet interface, the configuration should use one of these styles:</p>
<p>Refer to the next-hop global unicast address (or unique local address) only</p>
<p>Refer to both the outgoing interface and next-hop global unicast address (or unique local address)</p>
<p>Refer to both the outgoing interface and next-hop link-local address</p>

<p>Static IPv6 Host Routes</p>
<p>a route to a single host IP address. With IPv4, those routes use a /32 mask, which identifies a single IPv4 address in the ip route command; with IPv6, a /128 mask identifies that single host in the ipv6 route command.</p>

Core Of the

Network &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>IOS considers static routes better than OSPF-learned routes by default due to administrative distance. IOS uses the same administrative distance concept and default values for IPv6 as it does for IPv4</p>
<p>IPv6 floating static route floats or moves into and out of the IPv6 routing table depending on whether the better (lower) administrative distance route learned by the routing protocol happens to exist currently.</p>
<p>To implement an IPv6 floating static route, just override the default administrative distance on the static route, making the value larger than the default administrative distance of the routing protocol.</p>
<p>ipv6 route 2001:db8:1111:7::/64 2001:db8:1111:9::3 130 command on R1 would do exactly that, setting the static route’s administrative distance to 130.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting Incorrect Static Routes That Appear in the IPv6 Routing Table</p>
<p>IOS cannot tell if you choose the incorrect outgoing interface, incorrect next-hop address, or incorrect prefix/prefix-length in a static route.</p>
<p>IOS puts the route into the IP routing table—even though the route may not work because of the poorly chosen parameters.</p>
<p>R1 cannot use its own IPv6 address as a next-hop address.</p>
<p>routes may have incorrect parameters. Check for these types of mistakes:</p>
<p>Step 1. Prefix/Length: Does the ipv6 route command reference the correct subnet ID (prefix) and mask (prefix length)?</p>
<p>Step 2. If using a next-hop IPv6 address that is a link-local address:</p>
<p>A. Is the link-local address an address on the correct neighboring router? (It should be an address on another router on a shared link.)</p>
<p>B. Does the ipv6 route command also refer to the correct outgoing interface on the local router?</p>
<p>Step 3. If using a next-hop IPv6 address that is a global unicast or unique local address, is the address the correct unicast address of the neighboring router?</p>
<p>Step 4. If referencing an outgoing interface, does the ipv6 route command reference the interface on the local router (that is, the same router where the static route is configured)?</p>
<p>The Static Route Does Not Appear in the IPv6 Routing Table</p>
<p>IOS makes the following checks before adding the route;</p>
<p>For ipv6 route commands that list an outgoing interface, that interface must be in an up/up state.</p>
<p>For ipv6 route commands that list a global unicast or unique local next-hop IP address (that is, not a link-local address), the local router must have a route to reach that next-hop address.</p>
<p>If another IPv6 route exists for that exact same prefix/prefix-length, the static route must have a better (lower) administrative distance.</p>
<p>The Neighbor Discovery Protocol</p>
<p>with 1pv4 ARP works as a separate protocol; with IPv6, the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), a part of ICMPv6, performs the same functions.</p>
<p>few of the functions of the NDP protocol (RFC 4861). Some of those NDP functions are</p>
<p>Neighbor MAC Discovery: An IPv6 LAN-based host will need to learn the MAC address of other hosts in the same subnet. NDP replaces IPv4’s ARP, providing messages that replace the ARP Request and Reply messages.</p>
<p>Router Discovery: Hosts learn the IPv6 addresses of the available IPv6 routers in the same subnet.</p>
<p>SLAAC: When using Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC), the host uses NDP messages to learn the subnet (prefix) used on the link plus the prefix length.</p>
<p>DAD: Before using an IPv6 address, hosts use NDP to perform a Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) process, to ensure no other host uses the same IPv6 address before attempting to use it.</p>
<p>Discovering Neighbor Link Addresses with NDP NS and NA</p>
<p>using a pair of matched solicitation and advertisement messages: the Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages.</p>
<p>the NS acts like an IPv4 ARP request, asking the host with a particular unicast IPv6 address to send back a reply. The NA message acts like an IPv4 ARP Reply, listing that host’s MAC address.</p>
<p>Neighbor Solicitation (NS): This message asks the host with a particular IPv6 address (the target address) to reply with an NA message that lists its MAC address. The NS message is sent to the solicited-node multicast address associated with the target address, so the message is processed only by hosts whose last six hex digits match the address that is being queried.</p>
<p>Neighbor Advertisement (NA): This message lists the sender’s IPv6 and MAC addresses. It can be sent in reply to an NS message, and if so, the packet is sent to the IPv6 unicast address of the host that sent the original NS message. A host can also send an unsolicited NA, announcing its IPv6 and MAC addresses, in which case the message is sent to the all-IPv6-hosts local-scope multicast address FF02::1.</p>

<p>Discovering Routers with NDP RS and RA</p>
<p>NDP defines two messages that allow any host to discover all routers in the subnet:</p>
<p>Router Solicitation (RS): This message is sent to the “all-IPv6-routers” local-scope multicast address of FF02::2 so that the message asks all routers, on the local link only, to identify themselves.</p>
<p>Router Advertisement (RA): This message, sent by the router, lists many facts, including the link-local IPv6 address of the router. When sent in response to an RS message, it flows back to either the unicast address of the host that sent the RS or to the all-IPv6-hosts address FF02::1. Routers also send RA messages without being asked, sent to the all-IPv6-hosts local-scope multicast address of FF02::1.</p>

<p>also periodically send unsolicited RA messages</p>
<p>the RA messages flow to the FF02::1 all-nodes IPv6 multicast address.</p>
<p>Using SLAAC with NDP RS and RA</p>

<p>The process goes by the name Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).</p>
<p>Learn the IPv6 prefix used on the link, from any router, using NDP RS/RA messages.</p>
<p>Build an address from the prefix plus an interface ID, chosen either by using EUI-64 rules or as a random value.</p>
<p>Before using the address, first use DAD to make sure that no other host is already using the same address.</p>

<p>Discovering Duplicate Addresses Using NDP NS and NA</p>
<p>IPv6 uses the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) process before using a unicast address to make sure that no other node on that link is already using the address. Hosts use DAD not only at the end of the SLAAC process, but also any time that a host interface initializes, no matter whether using SLAAC, DHCP, or static address configuration. When performing DAD, if another host already uses that address, the first host simply does not use the address until the problem is resolved.</p>
<p>a host sends an NS message for its own IPv6 address. No other host should be using that address, so no other host should send an NDP NA in reply. However, if another host already uses that address, that host will reply with an NA, identifying a duplicate use of the address.</p>
<p>Hosts do the DAD check for each of their unicast addresses, link-local addresses included, both when the address is first used and each time the host’s interface comes up.</p>
<p>NDP Summary</p>
<p>NDP does more than what is listed in this chapter, and the protocol allows for addition of other functions, so NDP might continue to grow over time. For now, use Table 25-3 as a study reference for the four NDP features discussed here.</p>

<p>Full mesh: For any set of network nodes, a design that connects a link between each pair of nodes.</p>
<p>Partial mesh: For any set of network nodes, a design that connects a link between some pairs of nodes, but not all. In other words, a mesh that is not a full mesh.</p>

<p>two-tier design is indeed a hybrid design that uses both a star topology at the access layer and a partial mesh at the distribution layer.</p>

<p>PoE Operation</p>
<p>PoE must (and does) have processes in place to determine if PoE is needed, and for how much power, before applying any potentially harmful power levels to the circuit.</p>
<p>autonegotiation mechanisms need to work before the PD has booted,</p>
<p>By using these IEEE autonegotiation messages and watching for the return signal levels, PoE can determine whether the device on the end of the cable requires power (that is, it is a PD) and how much power to supply</p>
<p>Step 1. Do not supply power on a PoE-capable port unless negotiation identifies that the device needs power.</p>
<p>Step 2. Use Ethernet autonegotiation techniques, sending low power signals and monitoring the return signal, to determine the PoE power class, which determines how much power to supply to the device.</p>
<p>Step 3. If the device is identified as a PD, supply the power per the power class, which allows the device to boot.</p>
<p>Step 4. Monitor for changes to the power class, both with autonegotiation and listening for CDP and LLDP messages from the PD.</p>
<p>Step 5. If a new power class is identified, adjust the power level per that class.</p>
<p>PDs signaling how many watts of power they would like to receive from the PSE. Depending on the specific PoE standard, the PSE will then supply the power, either over two pairs or four pairs, as noted in Table 13-2.</p>

<p>PoE and LAN Design</p>
<p>some of the key points to consider when planning a LAN design that includes PoE:</p>
<p>Powered Devices: Determine the types of devices and specific models, along with their power requirements.</p>
<p>Power Requirements: Plan the numbers of different types of PDs to connect into each wiring closet to build a power budget. That power budget can then be processed to determine the amount of PoE power to make available through each switch.</p>
<p>Switch Ports: Some switches support PoE standards on all ports, some on no ports, some on a subset of ports. Research the various switch models so that you purchase enough PoE-capable ports for the switches planned for each wiring closet.</p>
<p>Switch Power Supplies: Without PoE, when purchasing a switch, you choose a power supply so that it delivers enough power to power the switch itself. With PoE, the switch acts as a distributor of electrical power, so the switch power supply must deliver many more watts than it needs to run the switch itself. You will need to create a power budget per switch, based on the number of connected PDs, and purchase power supplies to match those requirements.</p>
<p>PoE Standards versus Actual: Consider the number of PoE switch ports needed, the standards they support, the standards supported by the PDs, and how much power they consume. For instance, a PD and a switch port may both support PoE+, which supports up to 30 watts supplied by the PSE. However, that powered device may need at most 9 watts to operate, so your power budget needs to reserve less power than the maximum for those devices.</p>

<p>Cisco switches also support two different configuration options that then use a dynamic protocol to negotiate whether a particular link becomes part of an EtherChannel or not. Basically, the configuration enables a protocol for a particular channel-group number. At that point, the switch can use the protocol to send messages to/from the neighboring switch and discover whether their configuration settings pass all checks. If a given physical link passes, the link is added to the EtherChannel and used; if not, it is placed in a down state, and not used, until the configuration inconsistency can be resolved.</p>

<li>The broadcast frames will keep being received on each switch then broadcasted again.</li>

<h2 id="mac-table-instability">Mac Table instability</h2>
<ol>
<li>Broadcast storm is causing broadcast packets going in and out of every port, the</li>
<li>Switch has to keep updating the source mac address of those packets.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="multiple-frame-transmission">Multiple frame transmission</h2>
<p>Issues can be cause when multiples of the same frame are received on a port.</p>
<p>Spanning tree must build a topology so it can figure out if there is a loop in the network, and pick which port(s) to block to stop any network loops.</p>
<p>Spanning tree controls all ports in the network and puts them in different port “states”. These states help spanning tree learn the network topology and decide which ports to forward or block. This process is called convergence. Convergence happens whenever spanning tree realizes that there has been a change in the network. (a new switch is added or a link goes down.)The port states are Blocking, Listening, Learning, Forwarding and Disabled.</p>
<p>Blocking</p>
<p>• Stable state</p>
<p>• Mac addresses are not learned on this port</p>
<p>• Port does not forward any fram</p>
<p>Listening</p>
<p>• Removes old or “stale” mac address entries from this port if no frames are recieved for that mac address while it is in this state.</p>
<p>• Transitory state that is temporary while spanning tree converges.</p>
<p>• A port in this state does not forward any frames.</p>
<p>• Incoming frames mac addresses are not learned.</p>
<p>Learning</p>
<p>• Incoming mac addresses on this port are now learned.</p>
<p>• A port in this state does not forward any frames.</p>
<p>• Also a port in a transitory state.</p>
<p>Disabled</p>
<p>• Stable</p>
<p>• Mac addresses are not learned on this port</p>
<p>• Port does not forward any frames</p>
<p>How spanning tree decides.</p>
<p>To build out the topology, spanning tree elects designated ports and root ports and determines the lowest cost path to the root bridge. (root cost)</p>
<p>Cost is based on the operating speed of the link. Here are the cost values STP uses based on the speed of the link.</p>
<p>These are the cisco defaults:</p>
<p>10 Mbps = 100</p>
<p>100 Mbps = 19</p>
<p>1 gbps = 4</p>
<p>10 gbps = 2</p>
<p>100 gbps = N/A</p>
<p>1 tbps = N/A</p>
<p>You can change the values to a newer form with:</p>
<p># spanning-tree pathcost method long</p>
<p>Which changes the values to:</p>
<p>10 Mbps = 2,000,000</p>
<p>100 Mbps = 200,000</p>
<p>1 gbps = 20,000</p>
<p>10 gbps = 2,000</p>
<p>100 gbps = 200</p>
<p>1 tbps = 20</p>
<p>Designated ports and root ports</p>
<p>Spanning tree sends Hello BPDUs to determine the spanning tree topology. A port that sends forwards hello bpdus is called a designated port. A port that receives hello bpdus is called a designated port.</p>
<p>Hello BPDU</p>
<p>Hello bpdu contains a switches Bridge ID, the root bridge ID, the senders root cost. (cost to the root bridge), and the root switches timer values.</p>
<p>Bridge ID (BID)</p>
<p>Has an 8 byte value that is different on each switch. A 2-byte priority field. And a 6 byte system ID that is based on the mac address</p>
<p>Root Bridge ID</p>
<p>The Bridge ID of the switch that the sender thinks is currently the root switch.</p>
<p>Root Switches Timer Values</p>
<p>Hello Timer = How often Hello bpdus are sent</p>
<p>MaxAge Timer = The max time that spanning tree will wait not getting a hello bpdu before it reconverges the network.</p>
<p>Forward Delay Timer = How long a port stays in the listening and learning states.</p>
<p>Root Cost</p>
<p>The cost between the sender and the root bridge</p>
<p>Spanning tree elects a root bridge then decides the best path to the root bridge from all of the other switches. If there are multiple paths to the root bridge, then the worst path is blocked. All ports on the root bridge are set to a forwarding state.</p>
<p>The other switches elect a port that has the lowest cost path to the root bridge. These ports are called root ports. Root ports are always in a forwarding state.</p>

With source NAT, the one address used by the host
that resides outside the enterprise, which NAT does
not change, so there is no need for a contrasting
term.
Alternative: Think of it as outside public, because
the address is typically a public IPv4 address.
This term is not used with source NAT. With desti-
nation NAT, the address would represent a host that
resides outside the enterprise, but the address used
to represent that host as packets pass through the
local enterprise. &ldquo;&gt;</p>

Figure 10-5 Dynamic NAT &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>Host 10.1.1.1 sends its first packet to the server at 170.1.1.1.</p>
<p>As the packet enters the NAT router, the router applies some matching logic to decide whether the packet should have NAT applied. Because the logic has been configured to match source IP addresses that begin with 10.1.1, the router adds an entry in the NAT table for 10.1.1.1 as an inside local address.</p>
<p>The NAT router needs to allocate an IP address from the pool of valid inside global addresses. It picks the first one available (200.1.1.1, in this case) and adds it to the NAT table to complete the entry.</p>
<p>The NAT router translates the source IP address and forwards the packet.</p>
<p>The dynamic entry stays in the table as long as traffic flows occasionally. You can configure a timeout value that defines how long the router should wait, having not translated any packets with that address, before removing the dynamic entry. You can also manually clear the dynamic entries from the table using the clear ip nat translation * command.</p>
<p>NAT can be configured with more IP addresses in the inside local address list than in the inside global address pool.</p>
<p>If a new packet arrives from yet another inside host, and it needs a NAT entry, but all the pooled IP addresses are in use, the router simply discards the packet. The user must try again until a NAT entry times out, at which point the NAT function works for the next host that sends a packet. Essentially, the inside global pool of addresses needs to be as large as the maximum number of concurrent hosts that need to use the Internet at the same time—unless you use PAT, as is explained in the next section.</p>

<p>static mappings are created using the ip nat inside source static command.</p>
<p>Source keyword means that NAT translates the source IP address of packets coming into its inside interfaces. The static keyword means that the parameters define a static entry, which should never be removed from the NAT table because of timeout. Because the design calls for two hosts—10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2—to have Internet access, two ip nat inside commands are needed.</p>
<p>show ip nat translations command lists the two static NAT entries created in the configuration. The show ip nat statistics command lists statistics, listing things such as the number of currently active translation table entries. The statistics also include the number of hits, which increments for every packet for which NAT must translate addresses.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-nat-configuration">Dynamic NAT Configuration</h3>
<p>Dynamic NAT still requires that each interface be identified as either an inside or outside interface</p>
<p>Dynamic NAT uses an access control list (ACL) to identify which inside local (private) IP addresses need to have their addresses translated, and it defines a pool of registered public IP addresses to allocate.</p>
<p>Step 1. Use the ip nat inside command in interface configuration mode to configure interfaces to be in the inside part of the NAT design (just like with static NAT).</p>
<p>Step 2. Use the ip nat outside command in interface configuration mode to configure interfaces to be in the outside part of the NAT design (just like with static NAT).</p>
<p>Step 3. Configure an ACL that matches the packets entering inside interfaces for which NAT should be performed.</p>
<p>Step 4. Use the ip nat pool name first-address last-address netmask subnet-mask command in global configuration mode to configure the pool of public registered IP addresses.</p>
<p>Step 5. Use the ip nat inside source list acl-number pool pool-name command in global configuration mode to enable dynamic NAT. Note the command references the ACL (step 3) and pool (step 4) per previous steps.</p>

<h3 id="nat-overload-pat-configuration">NAT Overload (PAT) Configuration</h3>
<p>If PAT uses a pool of inside global addresses, the configuration looks exactly like dynamic NAT, except the ip nat inside source list global command has an overload keyword added to the end. If PAT just needs to use one inside global IP address, the router can use one of its interface IP addresses</p>
<p>configuration when using an interface IP address as the sole inside global IP address:</p>
<p>Step 1. As with dynamic and static NAT, configure the ip nat inside interface sub-command to identify inside interfaces.</p>
<p>Step 2. As with dynamic and static NAT, configure the ip nat outside interface subcommand to identify outside interfaces.</p>
<p>Step 3. As with dynamic NAT, configure an ACL that matches the packets entering inside interfaces.</p>
<p>Step 4. Configure the ip nat inside source list acl-number interface type/number overload global configuration command, referring to the ACL created in step 3 and to the interface whose IP address will be used for translations.</p>

<p>ip nat inside source list 1 interface serial 0/0/0 overload command has several parameters</p>
<p>The list 1 parameter means the same thing as it does for dynamic NAT: inside local IP addresses matching ACL 1 have their addresses translated. The interface serial 0/0/0 parameter means that the only inside global IP address available is the IP address of the NAT router’s interface serial 0/0/0.</p>
<p>The router creates one NAT table entry for each unique combination of inside local IP address and port</p>
<p>NAT Troubleshooting</p>
<p>Reversed inside and outside</p>
<p>Static NAT: Check the ip nat inside source static command to ensure it lists the inside local address first and the inside global IP address second.</p>
<p>Dynamic NAT (ACL): Ensure that the ACL configured to match packets sent by the inside hosts match that host’s packets before any NAT translation has occurred.</p>
<p>Dynamic NAT (pool): For dynamic NAT without PAT, ensure that the pool has enough IP addresses\</p>
<p>A large or growing value in the second misses counter in the show ip nat statistics command output can indicate this problem. Also, compare the configured pool to the list of addresses in the NAT translation table (show ip nat translations). Finally, if the pool is small, the problem may be that the configuration intended to use PAT and is missing the overload keyword</p>
<p>PAT: It is easy to forget to add the overload option</p>
<p>perhaps NAT has been configured correctly, but an ACL exists on one of the interfaces, discarding the packets.</p>
<p>IOS processes ACLs before NAT. For packets exiting an interface, IOS processes any outbound ACL after translating the addresses with NAT.</p>

<h1 id="ospf-basics">OSPF Basics</h1>

<p>This chapter covers the following exam topics:</p>
<p>3.0 IP Connectivity</p>
<p>3.2 Determine how a router makes a forwarding decision by default</p>
<p>3.2.b Administrative distance</p>
<p>3.2.c Routing protocol metric</p>
<p>3.4 Configure and verify single area OSPFv2</p>

<p>3.4.b Point-to-point</p>
<p>3.4.c Broadcast (DR/BR selection)</p>
<p>3.4.d Router ID</p>
<p>Comparing Dynamic Routing Protocol Features</p>
<p>Routers add IP routes to their routing tables using three methods: connected routes, static routes, and routes learned by using dynamic routing protocols.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Routing protocol: A set of messages, rules, and algorithms used by routers for the overall purpose of learning routes. This process includes the exchange and analysis of routing information. Each router chooses the best route to each subnet (path selection) and finally places those best routes in its IP routing table. Examples include RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, and BGP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Routed protocol and routable protocol: Both terms refer to a protocol that defines a packet structure and logical addressing, allowing routers to forward or route the packets. Routers forward packets defined by routed and routable protocols. Examples include IP Version 4 (IPv4) and IP Version 6 (IPv6).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>path selection sometimes refers to part of the job of a routing protocol, in which the routing protocol chooses the best route.</p>
<p>Routing Protocol Functions</p>
<p>Learn routing information about IP subnets from neighboring routers.</p>
<p>Advertise routing information about IP subnets to neighboring routers.</p>
<p>If more than one possible route exists to reach one subnet, pick the best route based on a metric.</p>
<p>If the network topology changes—for example, a link fails—react by advertising that some routes have failed and pick a new currently best route. (This process is called convergence.)</p>
<p>Interior and Exterior Routing Protocols</p>
<p>IP routing protocols fall into one of two major categories: interior gateway protocols (IGP) or exterior gateway protocols (EGP).</p>
<p>IGP: A routing protocol that was designed and intended for use inside a single autonomous system (AS)</p>
<p>EGP: A routing protocol that was designed and intended for use between different autonomous systems</p>
<p>An AS is a network under the administrative control of a single organization.</p>
<p>routing protocols designed to exchange routes between routers in different autonomous systems are called EGPs. Today, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the only EGP used.</p>
<p>IGP Routing Protocol Algorithms</p>
<p>Distance vector (sometimes called Bellman-Ford after its creators)</p>
<p>Advanced distance vector (sometimes called “balanced hybrid”)</p>
<p>Link-state (OSPF)</p>
<p>Routing Information Protocol (RIP) was the first popularly used IP distance vector protocol, with the Cisco-proprietary Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) being introduced a little later.</p>
<p> proprietary routing protocol called Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)</p>
<p>it used more distance vector features than link-state, so it is more commonly classified as an advanced distance vector protocol.</p>
<p>Metrics</p>
<p>Routing protocols choose the best route to reach a subnet by choosing the route with the lowest metric</p>
<p> RIP uses a counter of the number of routers (hops) between a router and the destination subnet</p>
<p>OSPF totals the cost associated with each interface in the end-to-end route, with the cost based on link bandwidth</p>
<p>The bandwidth interface subcommand does not change the actual physical speed of the interface. It just tells IOS what speed to assume the interface is using.)</p>
<p>Other IGP Comparisons</p>
<p>Classless routing protocols support variable-length subnet masks (VLSM) as well as manual route summarization (supernetting) by sending routing protocol messages that include the subnet masks in the message. The older RIPv1 and IGRP routing protocols—both classful routing protocols—do not.</p>
<p>Administrative Distance</p>
<p>If one company uses OSPF and the other uses EIGRP on at least one router, both OSPF and EIGRP must be used. Then that router can take routes learned by OSPF and advertise them into EIGRP, and vice versa, through a process called route redistribution.</p>
<p>When a single routing protocol learns multiple routes to the same subnet, the metric tells it which route is best. However, when two different routing protocols learn routes to the same subnet, because each routing protocol’s metric is based on different information, IOS cannot compare the metrics</p>
<p>When IOS must choose between routes learned using different routing protocols, IOS uses a concept called administrative distance. Administrative distance is a number that denotes how believable an entire routing protocol is on a single router. The lower the number, the better, or more believable, the routing protocol. For example, RIP has a default administrative distance of 120, OSPF uses a default of 110, and EIGRP defaults to 90. When using OSPF and EIGRP, the router will believe the EIGRP route instead of the OSPF route (at least by default). The administrative distance values are configured on a single router and are not exchanged with other routers</p>
<p>The show ip route command lists each route’s administrative distance as the first of the two numbers inside the brackets. The second number in brackets is the metric</p>
<p>IOS can be configured to change the administrative distance of a particular routing protocol, a particular route, or even a static route.</p>
<p>For example, the command ip route 10.1.3.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.130.253 defines a static route with a default administrative distance of 1, but the command ip route 10.1.3.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.130.253 210 defines the same static route with an administrative distance of 210</p>
<p>Topology Information and LSAs</p>
<p>Each LSA is a data structure with some specific information about the network topology; the LSDB is simply the collection of all the LSAs known to a router.</p>
<p>before sending an LSA to yet another neighbor, routers communicate, asking “Do you already have this LSA?,” and then sending the LSA to the next neighbor only if the neighbor has not yet learned about the LSA.</p>
<p>Routers reflood an LSA when some information changes (for example, when a link goes up or comes down). They also reflood each LSA based on each LSA’s separate aging timer (default 30 minutes).</p>
<p>Applying Dijkstra SPF Math to Find the Best Routes</p>
<p>Becoming neighbors: A relationship between two routers that connect to the same data link, created so that the neighboring routers have a means to exchange their LSDBs.</p>
<p>Exchanging databases: The process of sending LSAs to neighbors so that all routers learn the same LSAs.</p>
<p>Adding the best routes: The process of each router independently running SPF, on their local copy of the LSDB, calculating the best routes, and adding those to the IPv4 routing table.</p>
<p>The Basics of OSPF Neighbors</p>
<p>OSPF neighbors are routers that both use OSPF and both sit on the same data link. Two routers can become OSPF neighbors if connected to the same VLAN, or same serial link, or same Ethernet WAN link.</p>
<p>they must send OSPF messages and agree to become OSPF neighbors. To do so, the routers send OSPF Hello messages, introducing themselves to the potential neighbor. Assuming the two potential neighbors have compatible OSPF parameters, the two form an OSPF neighbor relationship, and would be displayed in the output of the show ip ospf neighbor command.</p>
<p>allows new routers to be dynamically discovered. That means new routers can be added to a network without requiring every router to be reconfigured. Instead, OSPF routers listen for OSPF Hello messages from new routers and react to those messages, attempting to become neighbors and exchange LSDBs.</p>
<p>Meeting Neighbors and Learning Their Router ID</p>
<p>process starts with messages called OSPF Hello messages. The Hellos in turn list each router’s router ID (RID), which serves as each router’s unique name or identifier for OSPF. Finally, OSPF does several checks of the information in the Hello messages to ensure that the two routers should become neighbors.</p>
<p>OSPF RIDs are 32-bit numbers.</p>
<p>By default, IOS chooses one of the router’s interface IPv4 addresses to use as its OSPF RID. However, the OSPF RID can be directly configured</p>
<p>As soon as a router has chosen its OSPF RID and some interfaces come up, the router is ready to meet its OSPF neighbors. OSPF routers can become neighbors if they are connected to the same subnet. To discover other OSPF-speaking routers, a router sends multicast OSPF Hello packets to each interface and hopes to receive OSPF Hello packets from other routers connected to those interfaces.</p>
<p>They continue to send Hellos at a regular interval based on their Hello timer settings. The Hello messages themselves have the following features:</p>
<p>The Hello message follows the IP packet header, with IP protocol type 89.</p>
<p>Hello packets are sent to multicast IP address 224.0.0.5, a multicast IP address intended for all OSPF-speaking routers.</p>
<p>OSPF routers listen for packets sent to IP multicast address 224.0.0.5, in part hoping to receive Hello packets and learn about new neighbors.</p>
<p>Each router keeps an OSPF state variable for how it views the neighbor.</p>
<p>Hello. This message tells R1 that R2 exists, and it allows R1 to move through the init state and quickly to a 2-way state.</p>
<p>The 2-way state is a particularly important OSPF state. At that point, the following major facts are true:</p>
<p>2-way means that the router is available to exchange its LSDB with the neighbor. In other words, it is ready to begin a 2-way exchange of the LSDB.</p>
<p>First, they tell each other a list of LSAs in their respective databases—not all the details of the LSAs, just a list. (Think of these lists as checklists.) Then each router can check which LSAs it already has and then ask the other router for only the LSAs that are not known yet.</p>
<p>the OSPF messages that actually send the LSAs between neighbors are called Link-State Update (LSU) packets. That is, the LSU packet holds data structures called link-state advertisements (LSA). The LSAs are not packets, but rather data structures that sit inside the LSDB and describe the topology.</p>
<p>Maintaining Neighbors and the LSDB</p>
<p>First, routers monitor each neighbor relationship using Hello messages and two related timers: the Hello Interval and the Dead Interval. Routers send Hellos every Hello Interval to each neighbor. Each router expects to receive a Hello from each neighbor based on the Hello Interval, so if a neighbor is silent for the length of the Dead Interval (by default, four times as long as the Hello Interval), the loss of Hellos means that the neighbor has failed.</p>
<p>Next, routers must react when the topology changes as well,</p>
<p>Each router’s LSDB now reflects the fact that the original router’s G0/0 interface failed, so each router will then use SPF to recalculate any routes affected by the failed interface.</p>
<p>A third maintenance task done by neighbors is to reflood each LSA occasionally, even when the network is completely stable. By default, each router that creates an LSA also has the responsibility to reflood the LSA every 30 minutes (the default), even if no changes occur. (Note that each LSA has a separate timer, based on when the LSA was created, so there is no single big event where the network is overloaded with flooding LSAs.)</p>
<p>Using Designated Routers on Ethernet Links</p>
<p>On Ethernet links, OSPF defaults to use a network type of broadcast, which causes OSPF to elect one of the routers on the same subnet to act as the designated router (DR).</p>
<p>These five OSPF routers elect one router to act as the DR and one router to be a backup DR (BDR).</p>
<p>The database exchange process on an Ethernet link does not happen between every pair of routers on the same VLAN/subnet. Instead, it happens between the DR and each of the other routers, with the DR making sure that all the other routers get a copy of each LSA.</p>
<p> The BDR watches the status of the DR and takes over for the DR if it fails. (When the DR fails, the BDR takes over, and then a new BDR is elected.)</p>
<p>The DR can send a packet to all OSPF routers in the subnet by using multicast IP address 224.0.0.5</p>
<p>The DR can send one set of messages to all the OSPF routers rather than sending one message to each router.</p>
<p>any OSPF router needing to send a message to the DR and also to the BDR (so it remains ready to take over for the DR) can send those messages to the “All SPF DRs” multicast address 224.0.0.6.</p>
<p>routers that are neither a DR nor a BDR—called DROthers by OSPF—never reach a full state because they do not exchange LSDBs directly with each other.</p>
<p>full state (called fully adjacent neighbors</p>
<p>2-way state (called neighbors)</p>
<p>all OSPF routers on the same link that reach the 2-way state—that is, they send Hello messages and the parameters match—are called neighbors. The subset of neighbors for which the neighbor relationship continues on and reaches the full state are called adjacent neighbors.</p>
<p>OSPF Areas and LSAs</p>
<p>A larger topology database requires more memory on each router.</p>
<p>The SPF algorithm requires processing power that grows exponentially compared to the size of the topology database.</p>
<p>A single interface status change anywhere in the internetwork (up to down, or down to up) forces every router to run SPF again!</p>
<p>OSPF Areas</p>
<p>Put all interfaces connected to the same subnet inside the same area.</p>
<p>An area should be contiguous.</p>
<p>Some routers may be internal to an area, with all interfaces assigned to that single area.</p>
<p>Some routers may be Area Border Routers (ABR) because some interfaces connect to the backbone area, and some connect to nonbackbone areas.</p>
<p>All nonbackbone areas must have a path to reach the backbone area (area 0) by having at least one ABR connected to both the backbone area and the nonbackbone area.</p>
<p>How Areas Reduce SPF Calculation Time</p>
<p>Routers require fewer CPU cycles to process the smaller per-area LSDB with the SPF algorithm, reducing CPU overhead and improving convergence time.</p>
<p>The smaller per-area LSDB requires less memory.</p>
<p>Changes in the network (for example, links failing and recovering) require SPF calculations only on routers in the area where the link changed state, reducing the number of routers that must rerun SPF.</p>
<p>Less information must be advertised between areas, reducing the bandwidth required to send LSAs.</p>
<p>(OSPFv2) Link-State Advertisements</p>
<p>One router LSA for each router in the area</p>
<p>One network LSA for each network that has a DR plus one neighbor of the DR</p>
<p>One summary LSA for each subnet ID that exists in a different area
Router LSAs Build Most of the Intra-Area Topology</p>
<p>Router LSAs, also known as Type 1 LSAs, describe the router in detail. Each lists a router’s RID, its interfaces, its IPv4 addresses and masks, its interface state, and notes about what neighbors the router knows about via each of its interfaces.</p>

<p>OSPF Config</p>
<p>This chapter covers the following exam topics:</p>
<p>3.0 IP Connectivity</p>
<p>3.2 Determine how a router makes a forwarding decision by default</p>
<p>3.2.b Administrative distance</p>
<p>3.2.c Routing protocol metric</p>
<p>3.4 Configure and verify single area OSPFv2</p>
<p>3.4.a Neighbor adjacencies</p>
<p>3.4.b Point-to-point</p>
<p>3.4.c Broadcast (DR/BR selection)</p>
<p>3.4.d Router ID</p>
<p>Implementing Single-Area OSPFv2</p>
<p>Step 1. Use the router ospf process-id global command to enter OSPF configuration mode for a particular OSPF process.</p>
<p>Step 2. (Optional) Configure the OSPF router ID by doing the following:</p>
<p>A. Use the router-id id-value router subcommand to define the router ID, or</p>
<p>B. Use the interface loopback number global command, along with an ip address address mask command, to configure an IP address on a loopback interface (chooses the highest IP address of all working loopbacks), or</p>
<p>C. Rely on an interface IP address (chooses the highest IP address of all working nonloopbacks).</p>
<p>Step 3. Use one or more network ip-address wildcard-mask area area-id router subcommands to enable OSPFv2 on any interfaces matched by the configured address and mask, enabling OSPF on the interface for the listed area.</p>
<p>OSPF Single-Area Configuration</p>

<p>FULL/DR: The neighbor state is full, and the neighbor is the DR.</p>
<p>FULL/BDR: The neighbor state is full, and the neighbor is the backup DR (BDR).</p>
<p>FULL/DROTHER: The neighbor state is full, and the neighbor is neither the DR nor BDR. (It also implies that the local router is a DR or BDR because the state is FULL.)</p>
<p>2WAY/DROTHER: The neighbor state is 2-way, and the neighbor is neither the DR nor BDR—that is, a DROther router. (It also implies that the local router is also a DROther router because otherwise the state would reach a full state.)</p>
<p>Verifying OSPF Configuration</p>
<p>If you have enable mode access, use the show running-config command to examine the configuration.</p>
<p>If you have only user mode access, use the show ip protocols command to re-create the OSPF configuration.</p>
<p>Use the show ip ospf interface [brief] command to determine whether the router enabled OSPF on the correct interfaces or not based on the configuration.</p>
<p>show ip ospf interface brief command shown here. It lists one line per interface, with the list showing all the interfaces on which OSPF has been enabled</p>
<p>the show ip ospf interface command with the brief keyword at the end lists a single line of output per interface, but the show ip ospf interface command (without the brief keyword) displays about 20 lines of output per interface</p>
<p>Configuring the OSPF Router ID</p>
<p>most enterprise networks that use OSPF choose to configure each router’s OSPF router ID</p>
<p>If the router-id rid OSPF subcommand is configured, this value is used as the RID.</p>
<p>If any loopback interfaces have an IP address configured, and the interface has an interface status of up, the router picks the highest numeric IP address among these loopback interfaces.</p>
<p>The router picks the highest numeric IP address from all other interfaces whose interface status code (first status code) is up. (In other words, an interface in up/down state will be included by OSPF when choosing its router ID.)</p>
<p>stops and restarts the OSPF process (with the clear ip ospf process command). So, if OSPF comes up, and later the configuration changes in a way that would impact the OSPF RID, OSPF does not change the RID immediately. Instead, IOS waits until the next time the OSPF process is restarted.</p>
<p>OSPF Interface Configuration Example</p>
<p>Step 1. Use the no network network-id area area-id subcommands in OSPF configuration mode to remove the network commands.</p>
<p>Step 2. Add one ip ospf process-id area area-id command in interface configuration mode under each interface on which OSPF should operate, with the correct OSPF process (process-id) and the correct OSPF area number.</p>
<p>Verifying OSPF Interface Configuration</p>
<p>The show ip protocols command relists most of the routing protocol configuration, so it does list some different details if you use interface configuration versus the network command</p>

<p>OSPF Passive Interfaces</p>
<p>When no routers exist on a link</p>
<p>OSPF continues to advertise about the subnet that is connected to the interface.</p>
<p>OSPF no longer sends OSPF Hellos on the interface.</p>
<p>OSPF no longer processes any received Hellos on the interface.</p>
<p>OSPF still advertises about the connected subnet, but OSPF also does not form neighbor relationships over the interface.</p>
<p>First, you can add the following command to the configuration of the OSPF process, in router configuration mode:</p>
<p>passive-interface type number</p>
<p>Alternately, the configuration can change the default setting so that all interfaces are passive by default and then add a no passive-interface command for all interfaces that need to not be passive:</p>
<p>passive-interface default</p>
<p>no passive-interface type number</p>

<p>OSPF Default Routes</p>
<p>All routers learn specific (nondefault) routes for subnets inside the company; a default route is not needed when forwarding packets to these destinations.</p>
<p>One router connects to the Internet, and it has a default route that points toward the Internet.</p>
<p>All routers should dynamically learn a default route, used for all traffic going to the Internet, so that all packets destined to locations in the Internet go to the one router connected to the Internet.</p>

<p>The output also shows a cost value of 1 for the other Gigabit interfaces, which is the default OSPF cost for any interface faster than 100 Mbps.</p>
<p>Setting the Cost Based on Interface and Reference Bandwidth</p>
<p>interface bandwidth setting does not influence the actual transmission speed. Instead, the interface bandwidth acts as a configurable setting to represent the speed of the interface, with the option to configure the bandwidth to match the actual transmission speed…or not</p>
<p>configuration of the interface bandwidth using bandwidth speed interface subcommand.</p>
<p>Reference_bandwidth / Interface_bandwidth</p>
<p>you should avoid changing the interface bandwidth as a means to influence the default OSPF cost.</p>
<p>any interface with an interface bandwidth of 100 Mbps or faster ties with a calculated OSPF cost of 1 when using the default reference bandwidth. So, when relying on the default OSPF cost calculation, it helps to configure the reference bandwidth to another value.</p>

<p>You can still use OSPF’s default cost calculation (and many do) just by changing the reference bandwidth with the auto-cost reference-bandwidth speed OSPF mode subcommand</p>
<p>For instance, in an enterprise whose fastest links are 10 Gbps (10,000 Mbps), you could set all routers to use auto-cost reference-bandwidth 10000, meaning 10,000 Mbps or 10 Gbps. In that case, by default, a 10-Gbps link would have an OSPF cost of 1, while a 1-Gbps link would have a cost of 10, and a 100-MBps link a cost of 100.</p>
<p>Set the cost explicitly, using the ip ospf cost x interface subcommand, to a value between 1 and 65,535, inclusive.</p>
<p>Although it should be avoided, change the interface bandwidth with the bandwidth speed command, with speed being a number in kilobits per second (Kbps).</p>
<p>Change the reference bandwidth, using router OSPF subcommand auto-cost reference-bandwidth ref-bw, with a unit of megabits per second (Mbps).</p>
<p>OSPF Load Balancing</p>
<p>when the metrics tie for multiple routes to the same subnet, the router can put multiple equal-cost routes in the routing table (the default is four different routes) based on the setting of the maximum-paths number router subcommand</p>
<p>the default (and better) method, the load balancing could be on a per-destination IP address basis.</p>

<p>Configuring to Influence the DR/BDR Election</p>
<p>If the DR fails, the BDR becomes the DR, and a new BDR is elected.</p>
<p>When a better router enters the subnet, no preemption of the existing DR or BDR occurs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Preemption: If a new router is configured to be the DR, it will not become the DR until the OSPF process is reset.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of these rules, while you can configure a router to be the best (highest priority) router to become the DR in an election, doing so only increases that router’s statistical chances of being the DR at a given point in time. If the router fails, other routers will become DR and BDR, and the best router will not be DR again until the current DR and BDR fail.</p>
<p>The highest OSPF interface priority: The highest value wins during an election, with values ranging from 0 to 255.</p>
<p>The highest OSPF Router ID: If the priority ties, the election chooses the router with the highest OSPF RID.</p>
<p>If an engineer preferred that R1 be the DR, the engineer could add the configuration in Example 21-5 to set R1’s interface priority to 99. (default of 1)</p>

<p>4.0 IP Services</p>
<p>4.7 Explain the forwarding per-hop behavior (PHB) for QoS such as classification, marking, queuing, congestion, policing, shaping</p>
<p>QoS defines these actions as per-hop behaviors (PHBs), which is a formal term to refer to actions other than storing and forwarding a message.</p>
<h2 id="qos-managing-bandwidth-delay-jitter-and-loss">QoS: Managing Bandwidth, Delay, Jitter, and Loss</h2>
<p>four characteristics of network traffic:</p>
<p>Bandwidth</p>
<p>refers to the speed of a link, in bits per second (bps)</p>
<p>helps to also think of bandwidth as the capacity of the link, in terms of how many bits can be sent over the link per second.</p>
<p>Delay</p>
<p>the time between sending one packet and that same packet arriving at the destination host</p>
<p>Round-trip delay</p>
<p>the time it takes to send one packet between two hosts and receive one back</p>
<p>Jitter</p>
<p>variation in one-way delay between consecutive packets sent by the same application</p>
<p>Loss</p>
<p>the number of lost messages, usually as a percentage of packets sent.</p>
<p>people think of loss as something caused by faulty cabling or poor WAN services. That is one cause. However, more loss happens because of the normal operation of the networking devices, in which the devices’ queues get too full, so the device has nowhere to put new packets, and it discards the packet.</p>

<p>Quality of Experience (QoE) - users’ perception of their use of the application on the network.</p>
<p>Voice and Video Applications</p>
<p>A flow is all the data moving from one application to another over the network, with one flow for each direction</p>
<p>For example, if you open a website and connect to a web server, the web page content that moves from the server to the client is one flow.</p>
<p>From a voice perspective, a phone call between two IP phones would create a flow for each direction</p>
<p>Step 1. The phone user makes a phone call and begins speaking.</p>
<p>Step 2. A chip called a codec processes (digitizes) the sound to create a binary code (160 bytes with the G.711 codec, for example) for a certain time period (usually 20 ms).</p>
<p>Step 3. The phone places the data into an IP packet.</p>
<p>Step 4. The phone sends the packet to the destination IP phone.</p>

<p>QoS as Mentioned in This Book</p>
<p>“Classification and Marking” is about the marking of packets and the definition of trust boundaries.</p>
<p>“Queuing” describes the scheduling of packets to give one type of packet priority over another.</p>
<p>“Shaping and Policing” explains these two tools together because they are often used on opposite ends of a link.</p>
<p>“Congestion Avoidance” addresses how to manage the packet loss that occurs when network devices get too busy.</p>
<p>Classification and Marking</p>
<p>a type of QoS tool that classifies packets based on their header contents then marks the message by changing some bits in specific header fields</p>
<p>Classification Basics</p>
<p>QoS tools sit in the path that packets take when being forwarded through a router or switch, much like the positioning of ACLs. Like ACLs, QoS tools are enabled on an interface. Also like ACLs, QoS tools are enabled for a direction: packets entering the interface (before the forwarding decision) or for messages exiting the interface (after the forwarding decision).</p>
<p>classification refers to the process of matching the fields in a message to make a choice to take some QoS action</p>
<p>QoS tools perform classification (matching of header fields) to decide which packets to take certain QoS actions against. Those actions include the other types of QoS tools discussed in this chapter, such as queuing, shaping, policing, and so on.</p>

<p>Matching (Classification) Basics</p>
<p>Cisco and by RFCs, suggests doing complex matching early in the life of a packet and then marking the packet. Marking means that the QoS tool changes one or more header fields, setting a value in the header.</p>

<p>Classification on Routers with ACLs and NBAR</p>
<p>many QoS tools support the ability to simply refer to an IP ACL, with this kind of logic:</p>
<p>For any packet matched by the ACL with a permit action, consider that packet a match for QoS, so do a particular QoS action.</p>
<p>All these fields are matchable for QoS classification.</p>

Figure 11-5 Classification with Five Fields Used by Extended ACLs &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>not every classification can be easily made by matching with an ACL. In more challenging cases, Cisco Network Based Application Recognition (NBAR) can be used. NBAR is basically in its second major version, called NBAR2, or next-generation NBAR. In short, NBAR2 matches packets for classification in a large variety of ways that are very useful for QoS.</p>
<p>NBAR2 looks far beyond what an ACL can examine in a message</p>
<p>Cisco also organizes what NBAR can match in ways that make it easy to separate the traffic into different classes.</p>
<p>you might classify WebEx traffic and give it a unique DSCP marking. NBAR provides easy built-in matching ability for WebEx, plus more than 1000 different subcategories of applications.</p>
<p>NBAR refers to this idea of defining the characteristics of different applications as application signatures.)</p>

<p>Marking the IP Header</p>
<p>Marking a QoS field in the IP header works well with QoS because the IP header exists for the entire trip from the source host to the destination host.</p>
<p>IPv4 defines a Type of Service (ToS) byte in the IPv4 header, as shown in Figure 11-6. The original RFC defined a 3-bit IP Precedence (IPP) field for QoS marking. That field gave us eight separate values—binary 000, 001, 010, and so on, through 111—which when converted to decimal are decimals 0 through 7.</p>

<p>Those last 5 bits of the ToS byte per RFC 791 were mostly defined for some purpose but were not used in practice to any significant extent.</p>
<p>DSCP increased the number of marking bits to 6 bits, allowing for 64 unique values that can be marked. The DiffServ RFCs, which became RFCs back in the late 1990s, have become accepted as the most common method to use when doing QoS, and using the DSCP field for marking has become quite common.</p>
<p>IPv6 has a similar field to mark as well. The 6-bit field also goes by the name DSCP, with the byte in the IPv6 header being called the IPv6 Traffic Class byte.</p>

<p>Most often QoS plans use EF to mark voice payload packets. With voice calls, some packets carry voice payload, and other packets carry call signaling messages. Call signaling messages set up (create) the voice call between two devices, and they do not require low delay, jitter, and loss.</p>
<p>By default, Cisco IP Phones mark voice pay-load with EF, and mark voice signaling packets sent by the phone with another value called CS3.</p>
<p>Assured Forwarding (AF)</p>
<p>The Assured Forwarding (AF) DiffServ RFC (2597) defines a set of 12 DSCP values meant to be used in concert with each other</p>
<p>defines the concept of four separate queues in a queuing system. Additionally, it defines three levels of drop priority within each queue for use with congestion avoidance tools. With four queues, and three drop priority classes per queue, you need 12 different DSCP markings, one for each combination of queue and drop priority. (Queuing and congestion avoidance mechanisms are discussed later in this chapter.)</p>

<p>Use a priority queue with LLQ scheduling for interactive voice and video, to achieve low delay, jitter, and loss.</p>
<p>Put voice in a separate queue from video so that the policing function applies separately to each.</p>
<p>Define enough bandwidth for each priority queue so that the built-in policer should not discard any messages from the priority queues.</p>

<p>a 200-Mbps committed information rate (CIR).</p>
<p>the SP providing the WAN service agrees to allow the enterprise to send 200 Mbps of traffic in each direction. However, remember that the enterprise routers transmit the data at the speed of the access link, or 1 Gbps in this case.</p>
<p>The SP can police incoming packets, setting the policing rate to match the CIR that the customer chooses for that link.</p>
<p>Policers can also re-mark packets.</p>
<p>SP could mark the messages with a new marking value, with this strategy:</p>
<p>Re-mark packets that exceed the policing rate, but let them into the SP’s network.</p>
<p>If other SP network devices are experiencing congestion when they process the packet, the different marking means that device can discard the packet. However…</p>
<p>…if no other SP network devices are experiencing congestion when forwarding that re-marked packet, it gets through the SP network anyway.</p>
<p>SP can treat their customers a little better by discarding less traffic, while still protecting the SP’s network during times of stress.</p>
<p>key features of policing:</p>
<p>Key Topic.</p>
<p>It measures the traffic rate over time for comparison to the configured policing rate.</p>
<p>It allows for a burst of data after a period of inactivity.</p>
<p>It is enabled on an interface, in either direction, but typically at ingress.</p>
<p>It can discard excess messages but can also re-mark the message so that it is a candidate for more aggressive discard later in its journey.</p>

<p>schedules messages from the shaping queues based on the shaping rate</p>

<p>A shaper’s time interval refers to its internal logic and how a shaper averages, over time, sending at a particular rate</p>
<p>Because the interface transmits bits at 1 Gbps, it takes just .2 seconds, or 200 ms, to send all 200 million bits. Then the shaper must wait for the rest of the time interval, another 800 ms, before beginning the next time interval.</p>

<p>Shapers measure the traffic rate over time for comparison to the configured shaping rate.</p>
<p>Shapers allow for bursting after a period of inactivity.</p>
<p>Shapers are enabled on an interface for egress (outgoing packets).</p>
<p>Shapers slow down packets by queuing them and over time releasing them from the queue at the shaping rate.</p>
<p>Shapers use queuing tools to create and schedule the shaping queues, which is very important for the same reasons discussed for output queuing.</p>

<h1 id="rapid-spanning-tree-rstp">Rapid Spanning Tree (RSTP)</h1>

<p>2.0 Network Access</p>
<p>2.4 Configure and verify (Layer 2/Layer 3) EtherChannel (LACP)</p>
<p>2.5 Describe the need for and basic operations of Rapid PVST+ Spanning Tree Protocol and identify basic operations</p>
<p>2.5.a Root port, root bridge (primary/secondary), and other port names</p>
<p>2.5.b Port states (forwarding/blocking)</p>
<p>2.5.c PortFast benefits</p>
<p>Most network engineers make the distribution layer switches be the root.</p>
<p>STP Modes and Standards</p>
<p>Three options to configure on the spanning-tree mode command, which tells the switch which type of STP to use</p>
<p> the switches do not support STP or RSTP with the single tree (CST). They can use either the Cisco-proprietary and STP-based PVST+, Cisco-proprietary and RSTP-based RPVST+, or the IEEE standard MSTP.</p>
<p>MSTP allows the definition of as many instances (multiple spanning tree instances, or MSTIs) as chosen by the network designer but does not require one per VLAN.</p>
<p>STP and MSTP now exist as part of the 802.1Q standard, which defines VLANs and VLAN trunking.</p>
<p>The revised rules divide the original priority field into two separate fields, as shown in Figure 10-4: a 4-bit priority field and a 12-bit subfield called the system ID extension (which represents the VLAN ID</p>
<p>Cisco switches let you configure the BID, but only the priority part.</p>
<p>The switch fills in its universal (burned-in) MAC address as the system ID. It also plugs in the VLAN ID of a VLAN in the 12-bit system ID extension field; you cannot change that behavior either. The only part configurable by the network engineer is the 4-bit priority field.</p>
<p>the configuration command (spanning-tree vlan vlan-id priority x) requires a decimal number between 0 and 65,535. But not just any number in that range will suffice; it must be a multiple of 4096, as emphasized in the help text shown in Example 10-2.</p>
<p>#spanning-tree vlan x root primary (on the switch that should be primary)</p>
<p>#spanning-tree vlan x root secondary (on the switch that should be secondary)</p>
<p>These two commands cause the switch to make a choice of priority value but then store the chosen priority value in the spanning-tree vlan x priority value command. The command with root primary or root secondary does not appear in the configuration. When configuring root primary, the switch looks at the priority of the current root switch and chooses either (a) 24,576 or (b) 4096 less than the current root’s priority (if the current root’s priority is 24,576 or less) to the configuration instead. When configuring, root secondary always results in that switch using a priority of 28,672, with the assumption that the value will be less than other switches that use the default of 32,768, and higher than any switch configured as root primary.</p>
<p>How Switches Use the Priority and System ID Extension</p>
<p>Cisco Catalyst switches configure the priority value using a number that represents a 16-bit value; however, the system ID extension exists as the low-order 12 bits of that same number.</p>
<p>When the switch builds its BID to use for RSTP in a VLAN, it must combine the configured priority with the VLAN ID of that VLAN.</p>
<p>the configured priority results in a 16-bit priority that always ends with 12 binary 0s.</p>
<p>Root Switch: 24,576 (priority) + 9 (VLAN ID) = 24585</p>
<p>Local Switch: 32,768 (priority) + 9 (VLAN ID) = 32777</p>
<p>RSTP Methods to Support Multiple Spanning Trees</p>
<p>RSTP creates one tree—the Common Spanning Tree (CST)—while RPVST+ creates one tree for each and every VLAN.</p>
<p>RSTP sends one set of RSTP messages (BPDUs) in the network, no matter the number of VLANs, while RPVST+ sends one set of messages per VLAN.</p>
<p>RSTP and RPVST+ use different destination MAC addresses: RSTP with multicast address 0180.C200.0000 (an address defined in the IEEE standard), and RPVST+ with multicast address 0100.0CCC.CCCD (an address chosen by Cisco).</p>
<p>When transmitting messages on VLAN trunks, RSTP sends the messages in the native VLAN with no VLAN header/tag. RPVST+ sends each VLAN’s messages inside that VLAN—for instance, BPDUs about VLAN 9 have an 802.1Q header that lists VLAN 9.</p>
<p>RPVST+ adds an extra type-length value (TLV) to the BPDU that identifies the VLAN ID, while RSTP does not (because it does not need to, as RSTP ignores VLANs.)</p>
<p>Both view the 16-bit priority as having a 12-bit System ID Extension, with RSTP setting the value to 0000.0000.0000, meaning “no VLAN,” while RPVST+ uses the VLAN ID.</p>
<p>Other RSTP Configuration Options</p>
<p>Switch Priority: The global command spanning-tree vlan x priority y lets an engineer set the switch’s priority in that VLAN.</p>
<p>Primary and Secondary Root Switches: The global command spanning-tree vlan x root primary | secondary also lets you set the priority, but the switch decides on a value to make that switch likely to be the primary root switch (the root) or the secondary root switch (the switch that becomes root if the primary fails).</p>
<p>Port Costs: The interface subcommand spanning-tree [vlan x] cost y lets an engineer set the switch’s STP/RSTP cost on that port, either for all VLANs or for a specific VLAN on that port. Changing those costs then changes the root cost for some switches, which impacts the choice of root ports and designated ports.</p>

<p>There are a lot of great CCNA resources out there. This list does not include all of them. Only the ones that I personally used to pass the CCNA 200-301 exam.</p>
<p>Materials for CCNA are generally separated into 5 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Books</li>
<li>Video courses</li>
<li>Labs</li>
<li>Practice test</li>
<li>Flashcards</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<h3 id="wendell-odom-ocg-official-cert-guide-library">Wendell Odom OCG Official cert guide library</h3>
<p>To me, this is the king of CCNA study materials. Some people do not like reading but this will give you more depth than any other resource on this list. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CCNA-200-301-Official-Guide-Library/dp/1587147149/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=ccna+200-301&sr=8-1" rel="external" target="_blank">Link.</a></p>
<h3 id="todd-lammle-books">Todd Lammle Books</h3>
<p>Yes, I read both the OCG and Todd Lammle books cover to cover. No, I do not recommend doing this. Todd has a great way of adding humor into networking. If you need to build up your networking from the ground up. These books are great. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cisco-CCNA-Certification-Set-200-301/dp/1119677610/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=ccna+200-301&sr=8-8&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.18ed3cb5-28d5-4975-8bc7-93deae8f9840" rel="external" target="_blank">Link.</a></p>
<h2 id="video-courses">Video Courses</h2>
<h3 id="cbt-nuggets">CBT Nuggets</h3>
<p>Jeremy Ciara makes learning networking so much fun. This was a great course but is not enough for you to pass the exam on it&rsquo;s own. Also, a CBT nuggets monthly subscription will set you back $59 per month. <a href="https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/cisco/ccna" rel="external" target="_blank">Link.</a></p>
<h3 id="jeremys-it-lab">Jeremy&rsquo;s IT Lab</h3>
<p>Jermey&rsquo;s IT lab course was the most informative for me. Jeremy is really great at explaining the more complex topics. Jeremy&rsquo;s course also includes Packet Tracer labs and and in depth Anki flashcard deck for free. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8W9oMNSuwo&list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ" rel="external" target="_blank">Link.</a></p>
<h2 id="labs">Labs</h2>
<h3 id="david-bombals-packet-tracer-labs">David Bombal&rsquo;s Packet Tracer Labs</h3>
<p>These labs will really make you think. Although they do steer off the exam objectives a bit. <a href="https://courses.davidbombal.com/p/cisco-ccna-packet-tracer-ultimate-labs-ccna-exam-prep-labs" rel="external" target="_blank">Link.</a></p>
<h3 id="jeremys-it-labs">Jeremy&rsquo;s IT labs</h3>
<p>These were my favorite labs by far. Very easy to set up with clear instructions and video explanations.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8W9oMNSuwo&list=PLxbwE86jKRgMpuZuLBivzlM8s2Dk5lXBQ" rel="external" target="_blank">Link.</a></p>
<h2 id="practice-test">Practice test</h2>
<h3 id="boson-exsim">Boson Exsim</h3>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stress this enough. if there is one resource that you invest some money into. it&rsquo;s the Boson practice exams. This is a test simulator that is very close to what the actual test will be like. Exsim comes with 3 exams.</p>
<p>After taking one of these practice tests you will get a breakdown of your scores per category. You will also get to go through all of your questions and see detailed explantations for why each answer is right or wrong.</p>
<p>These practice exams were crucial for me to understand where my knowledge gaps were. <a href="https://www.boson.com/practice-exam/200-301-cisco-ccna-practice-exam" rel="external" target="_blank">Link.</a></p>
<h2 id="subnettingpracticecom">Subnettingpractice.com</h2>
<p>You can learn subnetting pretty good. Then forget some of the steps a month later and have to learn all over again. It was very helpful to go over some of these subnetting questions once in a while. <a href="https://subnettingpractice.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Link.</a></p>
<h2 id="flashcards">Flashcards</h2>
<h3 id="anki-deck">Anki Deck</h3>
<p>These are the only flashcards I used. It is very nice not to have to create your own flashcards. Having the Anki app on your phone is very convenient. You can study whenever you have a few minutes of downtime.</p>
<p>Anki also used spaced-repetition. It will give you harder flashcards more often based on how you rate their difficulty.</p>
<p>This particular deck goes along with the OCG. You can filter by chapter and add more as you get through the book.</p>
<p>I will be using Anki flashcards for every exam in the future. <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/591991787" rel="external" target="_blank">Link.</a></p>
<h2 id="my-top-3">My Top 3</h2>
<p>Be careful not to use too many resources. You may get a bit overwhelmed. Especially if this is your first certification like it was for me. You will be building study habits and learning how to read questions correctly. So focus on quality over quantity.</p>
<p>If I had to study for the CCNA again, I would use these three resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>OCG</li>
<li>Boson Exsim</li>
<li>Anki Flashcards</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="router-operation">Router Operation</h1>

<p>The configuration of IP addresses differs in some ways, with switches using a VLAN interface and routers using an IP address configured on each working interface.</p>
<p>switches do not have auxiliary ports.</p>
<p>Layer 2 switches support the show mac address-table command, while Cisco routers do not.</p>
<p>routers support the show ip route command, while Cisco Layer 2 switches do not.</p>
<p>Layer 2 switches use the show interfaces status command to list one line of output per interface (and routers do not)</p>
<p>show protocols command. This command confirms the state of each of the three R1 interfaces in Figure 15-6 and the IP address and mask configured on those same interfaces.</p>

<h1 id="routing-in-the-lan">Routing in the LAN</h1>

<p>A. Use the sdm prefer lanbase-routing command (or similar) in global configuration mode to change the switch forwarding ASIC settings to make space for IPv4 routes at the next reload of the switch.</p>
<p>B. Use the reload EXEC command in enable mode to reload (reboot) the switch to pick up the new sdm prefer command setting.</p>
<p>C. Once reloaded, use the ip routing command in global configuration mode to enable the IPv4 routing function in IOS software and to enable key commands like show ip route.</p>
<p>if you then enabled OSPF on the Layer 3 switch, the configuration and verification would work the same as it does on a router, as discussed in Chapter 20, “Implementing OSPF.” The routes that IOS adds to the Layer 3 switch’s IP routing table would list the VLAN interfaces as outgoing interfaces.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting Routing with SVIs</p>
<p>look to those first few configuration commands listed in the configuration checklist found in the earlier section “Configuring Routing Using Switch SVIs.” Those commands are sdm prefer (followed by a reload) and then ip routing (after the reload).</p>
<p>The sdm prefer command changes how the switch forwarding chips allocate memory for different forwarding tables, and changes to those tables require a reload of the switch. By default, many access switches that support Layer 3 switching still have an SDM default that does not allocate space for an IP routing table. Once changed and reloaded, the ip routing command then enables IPv4 routing in IOS software. Both are necessary before some Cisco switches will act as a Layer 3 switch.</p>
<p>Scenario 1: The last access interface in VLAN 10 is shut down (F0/1), so IOS shuts down the VLAN 10 interface.</p>
<p>Scenario 2: VLAN 20 (not VLAN interface 20, but VLAN 20) is deleted, which results in IOS then bringing down (not shutting down) the VLAN 20 interface.</p>
<p>Scenario 3: VLAN 30 (not VLAN interface 30, but VLAN 30) is shut down, which results in IOS then bringing down (not shutting down) the VLAN 30 interface.</p>
<p>VLAN Routing with Layer 3 Switch Routed Ports</p>
<p>On a routed port, the switch does not perform Layer 2 switching logic on that frame. Instead, frames arriving in a routed port trigger the Layer 3 routing logic, including</p>
<p>Stripping off the incoming frame’s Ethernet data-link header/trailer</p>
<p>Making a Layer 3 forwarding decision by comparing the destination IP address to the IP routing table</p>
<p>Adding a new Ethernet data-link header/trailer to the packet</p>
<p>Forwarding the packet, encapsulated in a new frame</p>
<p>The exam topics do not mention routed interfaces specifically, but the exam topics do mention L3 EtherChannels, meaning Layer 3 EtherChannels.</p>
<p>Implementing Routed Interfaces on Switches</p>
<p>Enabling a switch interface to be a routed interface instead of a switched interface is simple: just use the no switchport subcommand on the physical interface.</p>
<p>To make the port stop acting like a switch port and instead act like a router port, use the no switchport command on the interface.</p>
<p>Once the port is acting as a routed port, think of it like a router interface</p>
<p>the routed interface will show up differently in command output in the switch. In particular, for an interface configured as a routed port with an IP address, like interface GigabitEthernet0/1 in the previous example:</p>
<p>Key Topic.</p>
<p>show interfaces: Similar to the same command on a router, the output will display the IP address of the interface. (Conversely, for switch ports, this command does not list an IP address.)</p>
<p>show interfaces status: Under the “VLAN” heading, instead of listing the access VLAN or the word trunk, the output lists the word routed, meaning that it is a routed port.</p>
<p>show ip route: Lists the routed port as an outgoing interface in routes.</p>
<p>show interfaces type number switchport: If a routed port, the output is short and confirms that the port is not a switch port. (If the port is a Layer 2 port, this command lists many configuration and status details.)</p>
<p> All the ports that are links directly between the Layer 3 switches can be routed interfaces.</p>
<p>Implementing Layer 3 EtherChannels</p>
<p>each pair of switches has one routing protocol neighbor relationship with the neighbor, and not two. Each switch learns one route per destination per pair of links, and not two. IOS then balances the traffic, often with better balancing than the balancing that occurs with the use of multiple IP routes to the same subnet.</p>
<p>Step 1. Configure the physical interfaces as follows, in interface configuration mode:</p>
<p>A. Add the channel-group number mode on command to add it to the channel. Use the same number for all physical interfaces on the same switch, but the number used (the channel-group number) can differ on the two neighboring switches.</p>
<p>B. Add the no switchport command to make each physical port a routed port.</p>
<p>Step 2. Configure the PortChannel interface:</p>
<p>A. Use the interface port-channel number command to move to port-channel configuration mode for the same channel number configured on the physical interfaces.</p>
<p>B. Add the no switchport command to make sure that the port-channel interface acts as a routed port. (IOS may have already added this command.)</p>
<p>C. Use the ip address address mask command to configure the address and mask.</p>
<p>Cisco uses the term EtherChannel in concepts discussed in this section and then uses the term PortChannel, with command keyword port-channel, when verifying and configuring EtherChannels.</p>
<p>although the physical interfaces and PortChannel interface are all routed ports, the IP address should be placed on the PortChannel interface only. In fact, when the no switchport command is configured on an interface, IOS adds the no ip address command to the interface.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting Layer 3 EtherChannels</p>
<p>look at the configuration of the channel-group command, which enables an interface for an EtherChannel. Second, you should check a list of settings that must match on the interfaces for a Layer 3 EtherChannel to work correctly.</p>
<p>As for the channel-group interface subcommand, this command can enable EtherChannel statically or dynamically. If dynamic, this command’s keywords imply either Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) or Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) as the protocol to negotiate between the neighboring switches whether they put the link into the EtherChannel.</p>
<p>no switchport: The PortChannel interface must be configured with the no switchport command, and so must the physical interfaces.</p>
<p>Speed: The physical ports in the channel must use the same speed.</p>
<p>duplex: The physical ports in the channel must use the same duplex.</p>

</ul>
<p>URL Filtering: This feature</p>
<ul>
<li>examines the URLs in each web request, categorizes the URLs, and either filters or rate limits the traffic based on rules. The Cisco Talos security group monitors and creates reputation scores for each domain known in the Internet, with URL filtering being able to use those scores in its decision to categorize, filter, or rate limit.</li>

<p>NGIPS Duties</p>
<p>Traditional IPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>using exploit signatures to compare packet flows, creating a log of events, and possibly discarding and/or redirecting packets.</li>

<p>Contextual Awareness:</p>
<ul>
<li>gather data from hosts—OS, software version/level, patches applied, applications running, open ports, applications currently sending data, and so on.

</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflection and Amplification Attacks</p>
<p>Reflection attack</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attacker sends packets to the reflector host</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>host (reflector) reflects the exchange toward the spoofed address that is the target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attacker might also send the spoofed packets to multiple reflectors, causing the target to receive multiple copies of the unexpected traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attackers source packet is the IP of the victim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when reflector (Corporate server) responds, it sends packets to victim</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Amplification attack</p>
<ul>
<li>attacker sends a small amount of traffic to a reflector to generate large volume of traffic to a target</li>
<li>leverages a protocol or service to generate the traffic</li>
<li>mechanisms of DNS and NTP have been exploited for this</li>
</ul>
<p>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</p>
<ul>
<li>can exploit the ARP table to communicate with other hosts on the local network</li>

<li>use common tools to uncover public details like who owns a domain and what IP address ranges are used there.</li>
<li>nslookup can reveal the owner of the domain and the IP address space registered to it.</li>
<li>The whois and dig commands are complementary tools that can query DNS information to reveal detailed information about domain owners, contact information, mail servers, authoritative name servers, and so on.</li>
<li>using ping sweeps to send pings to each IP address in the target range. Hosts that answer the ping sweep then become live targets.</li>
<li>Port scanning tools can then sweep through a range of UDP and TCP ports to see if a target host answers on any port numbers. Any replies indicate that a corresponding service is running on the target host.</li>
<li>not a true attack because nothing is exploited as a result.</li>
</ul>
<p>Buffer Overflow Attacks</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>incoming data might be stored in unexpected memory locations if a buffer is allowed to fill beyond its limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sending data that is larger than expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a vulnerability exists, the target system might store that data, overflowing its buffer into another area of memory, eventually crashing a service or the entire system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>attackers specially craft the large message by inserting malicious code in it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the target system stores that data as a result of a buffer overflow, then it can potentially run the malicious code without realizing.</p>

<h1 id="spanning-tree-protocol-basics">Spanning Tree Protocol Basics</h1>

<p>RSTP is the most common spanning tree protocol. And Cisco devices default to using RSTP.</p>
<p>MAC table instability</p>
<ul>
<li>The switches MAC address tables keep changing because frames with the same source MAC arrive on different ports.</li>
</ul>
<p>Broadcast storms</p>
<ul>
<li>forwarding of a frame repeatedly on the same links</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple frame transmission</p>
<ul>
<li>side effect of looping frames</li>
<li>Multiple copies are delivered to a host, confusing the host.</li>
</ul>
<p>What Spanning Tree Does</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>blocking state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>interfaces does not process any frames</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>except STP/RSTP messages and some other overhead messages</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>STP Convergence</p>
<ul>
<li>switches collectively realize that something has changed in the LAN topology</li>
<li>determine whether they need to change which ports block and which port forward</li>
</ul>
<p>How Spanning Tree works</p>
<p>three criteria to choose whether to put and interface in forwarding state:</p>
<p>elect a root switch.</p>
<ul>
<li>STP puts all working interfaces on the root switch in forwarding state</li>
</ul>
<p>nonroot switches</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>select the port with the least administrative cost (root port)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cost between itself and the root switch (root cost) (root cost path)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>root port (RP) gets put in a forwarding state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The switch with the lowest root cost, as compared with the other switches attached to the same link, is placed in forwarding state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That switch is the designated switch, and that switch&rsquo;s interface, attached to that segment, is called the designated port (DP)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>STP States</p>
<p>All the root switches ports</p>
<ul>
<li>forwarding</li>
<li>root switch is always the designated switch</li>
</ul>
<p>All nonroot switch&rsquo;s root ports</p>
<ul>
<li>forwarding</li>
<li>port with the least cost to the root switch (lowest root cost)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each LAN&rsquo;s designated port</p>
<ul>
<li>forwarding</li>
<li>switch forwarding the Hello on to the segment with the lowest root cost is the designated switch for the segment</li>
</ul>
<p>All other working ports</p>
<ul>
<li>blocking</li>
<li>Not used for forwarding frames</li>
<li>frames received on these interfaces to not forward</li>
</ul>
<p>The STP Bridge ID and Hello BPDU</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>bridge ID (BID)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8-byte value unique to each switch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2-byte priority field</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6-byte system ID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>based on a universal (burned-in) MAC address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bridge protocol data units (BPDU)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>configuration BPDUs, which switches</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>used to exchange information with each other (switches) The most common BPDU, called a</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hello BPDU,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sending switch&rsquo;s BID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>switches can tell which switch sent which Hello BPDU</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Root Bridge ID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BID the sender currently believes to be the root switch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sender&rsquo;s root cost</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>STP cost between this switch and current root</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timer values on the root switch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hello timer, MaxAge timer, and forward delay timer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Electing the Root Switch</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>based on the BIDs in the BPDUs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>root switch is the switch with the lowest numeric value for the BID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the two-part BID starts with the priority value,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>essentially the switch with the lowest priority becomes the root.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a tie occurs based on the priority portion of the BID,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the switch with the lowest MAC address portion of the BID is the root.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mac addresses are the second part of the BID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all switches claim to be the root by sending Hello BPDUs listing their own BID as the root BID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a switch hears a Hello that lists a better (lower) BID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that switch stops advertising itself as root and starts forwarding the superior Hello.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Hello sent by the better switch lists the better switch’s BID as the root.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>superior hello (better hello)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the listed root’s BID is better (numerically lower),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inferior hello (worse Hello), meaning that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the listed root’s BID is not as good (numerically higher)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>each nonroot switch chooses its one and only root port. A switch’s RP is its interface through which it has the least STP/RSTP cost to reach the root switch (least root cost).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing Each Switch&rsquo;s Root Port</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>each nonroot switch chooses its one and only root port.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>its interface through which it has the least STP/RSTP cost to reach the root switch (least root cost).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The STP/RSTP port cost is simply an integer value assigned to each interface, per VLAN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The switches also look at their neighbor’s root cost, as announced in Hello BPDUs received from each neighbor.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>SW3 calculates its cost to reach the root over the two possible paths by adding the advertised cost (in Hello messages) to the interface costs listed in the figure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The root switch sends Hellos, with a listed root cost of 0. The idea is that the root’s cost to reach itself is 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each switch places its root port into a forwarding state.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Choose based on the lowest neighbor bridge ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose based on the lowest neighbor port priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose based on the lowest neighbor internal port number.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing the Designated Port on each LAN Segment</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>final step to choose the STP/RSTP topology is to choose the designated port on each LAN segment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The designated port (DP) on each LAN segment is the switch port that advertises the lowest-cost Hello onto a LAN segment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a nonroot switch forwards a Hello, the nonroot switch sets the root cost field in the Hello to that switch’s cost to reach the root. In effect, the switch with the lower cost to reach the root, among all switches connected to a segment, becomes the DP on that segment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All DPs are placed into a forwarding state</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Two additional tiebreakers are needed in some cases</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>these would be unlikely today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A single switch can connect two or more interfaces to the same collision domain by connecting to a hub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In that case, the one switch hears its own BPDUs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, if a switch ties with itself, two additional tiebreakers are used:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the lowest interface STP/RSTP priority and,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if that ties, the lowest internal interface number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>switch ports connected to endpoint devices should become DPs and settle into a forwarding state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Configuring to influence the STP Topology</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>configure the bridge ID and  change STP/RSTP port costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>change the BID, the engineer can</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>set the priority used by the switch, while</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continues to use the universal MAC address as the final 48 bits of the BID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>giving a switch the lowest priority value among all switches will cause that switch to win the root election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to favor one link, give the ports on that link a lower cost, or to avoid a link, give the ports a higher cost.</p>

</ul>
<p>Details specific to STP</p>
<p>STP Activity When the Network Remains Stable</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An STP root switch sends a new Hello BPDU every 2 seconds by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each nonroot switch forwards the Hello on all DPs, but only after changing items listed in the Hello.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(As a result, the Hello flows once over every working link in the LAN.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When forwarding the Hello BPDU, each switch sets the root cost to that local switch’s calculated root cost. The switch also sets the “sender’s bridge ID” field to its own bridge ID. (The root’s bridge ID field is not changed.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1. The root creates and sends a Hello BPDU, with a root cost of 0, out all its working interfaces (those in a forwarding state).</p>
<p>Step 2. The nonroot switches receive the Hello on their root ports. After changing the Hello to list their own BID as the sender’s BID and listing that switch’s root cost, the switch forwards the Hello out all designated ports.</p>
<p>Step 3. Steps 1 and 2 repeat until something changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>When a switch ceases to receive the Hellos, or receives a Hello that lists different details, something has failed, so the switch reacts and starts the process of changing the spanning-tree topology.</li>
</ul>
<p>STP Timers That Manage STP Convergence</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>STP convergence process requires the use of three timers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All switches use the timers as dictated by the root switch, which the root lists in its periodic Hello BPDU messages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>hello</p>
<ul>
<li>2 seconds by default</li>
<li>Period between hellos created by the root</li>
</ul>
<p>MaxAge</p>
<ul>
<li>10 times the hello (20 seconds by default hello)</li>
<li>How long the switch will go without receiving any hellos before it attempts to change the stp topology</li>
</ul>
<p>Forward Delay</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>15 seconds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how long the port stays in listening and learning state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After MaxAge expires, the switch essentially makes all its STP choices again, based on any Hellos it receives from other switches.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing Interface States with STP</p>
<p>Roles, like root port and designated port, relate to how STP analyzes the LAN topology. States, like forwarding and blocking, tell a switch whether to send or receive frames.</p>
<p>When STP converges, a switch chooses new port roles, and the port roles determine the state (forwarding or blocking).</p>
<p>Switches using STP can simply move immediately from forwarding to blocking state, but they must take extra time to transition from blocking state to forwarding state.</p>
<p>when a port that formerly blocked needs to transition to forwarding, the switch first puts the port through two intermediate interface states.</p>
<p>Listening:</p>
<ul>
<li>interface does not forward frames.</li>
<li>switch removes old stale (unused) MAC table entries for which no frames are received from each MAC address during this period.</li>
<li>These stale MAC table entries could be the cause of the temporary loops.</li>
<li>Transitory</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>do not forward frames</li>
<li>switch begins to learn the MAC addresses of frames received on the interface.</li>
<li>Transitory</li>
</ul>
<p>Blocking</p>
<ul>
<li>does not forward frames</li>
<li>does not learn mac addresses</li>
<li>stable</li>
</ul>
<p>Forwarding</p>
<ul>
<li>learns mac addresses</li>
<li>forwards frames</li>
<li>stable</li>
</ul>
<p>Disabled</p>
<ul>
<li>does not forward or learn mac addresses</li>
<li>stable</li>
</ul>
<p>blocking &gt; listening, &gt; learning &gt; forwarding.</p>
<p>STP leaves the interface in each interim state for a time equal to the forward delay timer, which defaults to 15 seconds.</p>
<p>a convergence event that causes an interface to change from blocking to forwarding requires 30 seconds to transition from blocking to forwarding.</p>
<p>a switch might have to wait MaxAge seconds (default 20 seconds) before even choosing to move an interface from blocking to forwarding state.</p>

<p>place each port in either forwarding or blocking state</p>

<p>(RSTP calls the blocking state the discarding state.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they can both be used in the same network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSTP improves network convergence when topology changes occur, usually converging within a few seconds (or in slow conditions, in about 10 seconds).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>RSTP defines more cases in which the switch can avoid waiting for a timer to expire, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a switch can replace its root port, without any waiting to reach a forwarding state (in some conditions).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>replace a designated port, without any waiting to reach a forwarding state (in some conditions).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lowers waiting times for cases in which RSTP must wait for a timer.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The backup port concept provides a backup port on the local switch for a designated port.</p>

<p>backup ports apply only to designs that use hubs, so they are unlikely to be useful today.)</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>RSTP and the Alternate (Root) Port Role</p>
<p>alternate port</p>
<ul>
<li>both the RP and the alternate port must receive Hellos that identify the same root switch.</li>
</ul>
<p>the switch changes the former root port’s role and state:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the role from root port to a disabled port, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the state from forwarding to discarding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>without waiting on any timers, the switch changes roles and state for the alternate port:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>its role changes to be the root port, with a forwarding state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the new root port also does not need to spend time in other states, such as learning state, instead moving immediately to forwarding state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1. The link between SW1 and SW3 fails, so SW3’s current root port (Gi0/1) fails.</p>
<p>Step 2. SW3 and SW2 exchange RSTP messages to confirm that SW3 will now transition its former alternate port (Gi0/2) to be the root port. This action causes SW2 to flush the required MAC table entries.</p>
<p>Step 3. SW3 transitions Gi0/1 to the disabled role and Gi0/2 to the root port role.</p>
<p>Step 4. SW3 transitions Gi0/2 to a forwarding state immediately, without using learning state, because this is one case in which RSTP knows the transition will not create a loop.</p>
<p>RSTP States and Processes</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>RSTP keeps both the learning and forwarding states as compared with STP, for the same purposes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSTP does not even define a listening state,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSTP renames the blocking state to the discarding state and redefines its use slightly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RSTP uses the discarding state for what STP defines as two states: disabled state and blocking state.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>hubs also force the attached switch port to use half-duplex logic. RSTP assumes that all half-duplex ports may be connected to hubs, treating ports that use half duplex as shared ports.</p>

<li>
<p>RSTP converges more slowly on shared ports as compared to all point-to-point ports.</p>

<p>Optional STP Features</p>
<h2 id="etherchannel">Etherchannel</h2>
<ul>
<li>The switches treat the EtherChannel as a single interface with regard to STP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Layer 2 EtherChannels combine links that switches use as switch ports, with the switches using Layer 2 switching logic to forward and receive Ethernet frames over the EtherChannels. Layer 3 EtherChannels also combine links, but the switches use Layer 3 routing logic to forward packets over the EtherChannels.</p>
<p>PortFast</p>
<p>PortFast</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>allows a switch to immediately transition from blocking to forwarding, bypassing listening and learning states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>only ports on which you can safely enable PortFast are ports on which you know that no bridges, switches, or other STP-speaking devices are connected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cisco switches enable RSTP point-to-point edge ports by enabling PortFast on the port.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bpdu-guard">BPDU Guard</h2>
<p>An attacker could connect a switch to a port with a low STP/RSTP priority value. And make itself the root switch. The new STP/RSTP topology could have worse performance than the desired topology.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The attacker could plug into multiple ports, into multiple switches, become root, and actually forward much of the traffic in the LAN. Without the networking staff realizing it, the attacker could use a LAN analyzer to copy large numbers of data frames sent through the LAN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users could innocently harm the LAN when they buy and connect an inexpensive consumer LAN switch (one that does not use STP/RSTP). Such a switch, without any STP/RSTP function, would not choose to block any ports and could cause a loop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cisco BPDU Guard feature helps defeat these kinds of problems by disabling a port if any BPDUs are received on the port. So, this feature is particularly useful on ports that should be used only as an access port and never connected to another switch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, the BPDU Guard feature helps prevent problems with PortFast. PortFast should be enabled only on access ports that connect to user devices, not to other LAN switches. Using BPDU Guard on these same ports makes sense because if another switch connects to such a port, the local switch can disable the port before a loop is created.</p>

<p>3.3.d Floating static</p>
<p>Routers first learn connected routes, which are routes for subnets attached to a router interface. Routers can also use static routes, which are routes created through a configuration command (ip route) that tells the router what route to put in the IPv4 routing table. And routers can use a routing protocol, in which routers tell each other about all their known routes, so that all routers can learn and build routes to all networks and subnets.</p>
<p>Step 1. If the destination is local, send directly:</p>
<p>A. &lsquo;&lsquo;Find the destination host’s MAC address. Use the already-known Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table entry, or use ARP messages to learn the information.</p>
<p>B. Encapsulate the IP packet in a data-link frame, with the destination data-link address of the destination host.</p>
<p>For each received data-link frame, choose whether or not to process the frame. Process it if</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The frame has no errors (per the data-link trailer Frame Check Sequence [FCS] field).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The frame’s destination data-link address is the router’s address (or an appropriate multicast or broadcast address).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If choosing to process the frame at Step 1, de-encapsulate the packet from inside the data-link frame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a routing decision. To do so, compare the packet’s destination IP address to the routing table and find the route that matches the destination address. This route identifies the outgoing interface of the router and possibly the next-hop router.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encapsulate the packet into a data-link frame appropriate for the outgoing interface. When forwarding out LAN interfaces, use ARP as needed to find the next device’s MAC address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transmit the frame out the outgoing interface, as listed in the matched IP route.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The interface is in a working state. In other words, the interface status in the show interfaces command lists a line status of up and a protocol status of up.</li>
<li>The interface has an IP address assigned through the ip address interface subcommand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Routing Protocol Code: The legend at the top of the show ip route output (about nine lines) lists all the routing protocol codes (exam topic 3.1.a). This book references the codes for connected routes (C), local (L), static (S), and OSPF (O).</p>
<p>Prefix: The word prefix (exam topic 3.1.b) is just another name for subnet ID.</p>
<p>Mask: Each route lists a prefix (subnet ID) and network mask (exam topic 3.1.c) in prefix format, for example, /24.</p>
<p>The ARP Table on a Cisco Router</p>
<p>Dynamically learned ARP table entries have an upward counter, like the 35-minute value for the ARP table entry for IP address 172.16.1.9. By default, IOS will time out (remove) an ARP table entry after 240 minutes in which the entry is not used.</p>
<p>clear ip arp [ip-address] EXEC command.</p>
<p>Configuring Static Routes</p>
<p>The static route is considered a network route when the destination listed in the ip route command defines a subnet, or an entire Class A, B, or C network. In contrast, a default route matches all destination IP addresses, while a host route matches a single IP address (that is, an address of one host.)</p>
<p>However, the route that used the outgoing interface configuration is also noted as a connected route; this is just a quirk of the output of the show ip route command.</p>
<p>also lists a few statistics about all IPv4 routes. For example, the example shows two lines, for the two static routes configured in Example 16-4, but statistics state that this router has routes for eight subnets.</p>
<p>IOS adds and removes these static routes dynamically over time, based on whether the outgoing interface is working or not. For example, in this case, if R1’s S0/0/0 interface fails, R1 removes the static route to 172.16.2.0/24 from the IPv4 routing table. Later, when the interface comes up again, IOS adds the route back to the routing table.</p>
<p>Static Host Routes</p>
<p>To configure such a static route, the ip route command uses an IP address plus a mask of 255.255.255.255 so that the matching logic matches just that one address.</p>
<p>An engineer might use host routes to direct packets sent to one host over one path, with all other traffic to that host’s subnet over some other path. For instance, you could define these two static routes for subnet 10.1.1.0/24 and host 10.1.1.9, with two different next-hop addresses, as follows:</p>
<p>routers use the most specific route (that is, the route with the longest prefix length)</p>
<p>Floating Static Routes</p>
<p>the router must first decide which routing source has the better <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ccna-200-301-official/9780136755562/vol1_gloss.xhtml#gloss_24" rel="external" target="_blank">administrative distance</a>, with lower being better, and then use the route learned from the better source</p>
<p>By default, IOS considers static routes better than OSPF-learned routes. By default, IOS gives static routes an administrative distance of 1 and OSPF routes an administrative distance of 110</p>
<p>To implement a floating static route, you need to use a parameter on the ip route command that sets the administrative distance for just that route, making the value larger than the default administrative distance of the routing protocol. For example, the ip route 172.16.2.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.5.3 130</p>
<p>while the show ip route command lists the administrative distance of most routes, as the first of two numbers inside two brackets, the show ip route subnet command plainly lists the administrative distance.</p>
<p>Static Default Routes</p>
<p>ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 S0/0/1 creates a static default route on Router B1—a route that matches all IP packets—and sends those packets out interface S0/0/1.</p>
<p>show ip route</p>
<p>a *, meaning it is a candidate default route. A router can learn about more than one default route, and the router then has to choose which one to use; the * means that it is at least a candidate to become the default route.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting Static Routes</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The route is in the routing table but is incorrect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there a subnetting math error in the subnet ID and mask?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the next-hop IP address correct and referencing an IP address on a neighboring router?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the next-hop IP address identify the correct router?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the outgoing interface correct, and referencing an interface on the local router (that is, the same router where the static route is configured)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The route is not in the routing table.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For ip route commands that list an outgoing interface, that interface must be in an up/up state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For ip route commands that list a next-hop IP address, the local router must have a route to reach that next-hop address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can configure a static route so that IOS ignores these basic checks, always putting the IP route in the routing table. To do so, just use the permanent keyword on the ip route command. For example, by adding the permanent keyword to the end of the two commands as demonstrated in <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ccna-200-301-official/9780136755562/vol1_ch16.xhtml#ch16ex7" rel="external" target="_blank">Example 16-7</a>, R1 would now add these routes, regardless of whether the two WAN links were up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The route is in the routing table and is correct, but the packets do not arrive at the destination host.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many legitimate router features can cause these multiple routes to appear in a router’s routing table, including</p>
<ul>
<li>Static routes</li>
<li>Route autosummarization</li>
<li>Manual route summarization</li>
</ul>
<p>When a particular destination IP address matches more than one route in a router’s IPv4 routing table, the router uses the most specific route—in other words, the route with the longest prefix length mask.</p>
<p>A second way to identify the route a router will use, one that does not require any subnetting math, is the show ip route address command. The last parameter on this command is the IP address of an assumed IP packet. The router replies by listing the route it would use to route a packet sent to that address.</p>

<ul>
<li>configure the speed and duplex settings</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>add a text description to the interface</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>lists port #, Name, status, vlan, duplex, speed, and type</li>
</ul>
<p>a-full and a-100</p>
<p>a- means that the listed speed and duplex values were autonegotiated.</p>
<p>Autonegotiation</p>
<p>IEEE autonegotiation (IEEE standard 802.3u)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>each node states what it can do, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>then each node picks the best options that both nodes support:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the fastest speed and the best duplex setting, with full duplex being better than half duplex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>disable autonegotiation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure both the speed and duplex on a  switch interface</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when a node tries to use autonegotiation but hears nothing from the device.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Speed: Use your slowest supported speed (often 10 Mbps).</p>
<p>Duplex: If your speed = 10 or 100, use half duplex; otherwise, use full duplex.</p>
<p>Cisco switches can actually sense the speed used by other nodes, even without IEEE autonegotiation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cisco switches use this slightly different logic to choose the speed when autonegotiation fails:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed: Sense the speed (without using autonegotiation), but if that fails, use the IEEE default (slowest supported speed, often 10 Mbps).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duplex: Use the IEEE defaults: If speed = 10 or 100, use half duplex; otherwise, use full duplex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ethernet interfaces using speeds faster than 1 Gbps always use full duplex.</p>
</li>
<li>

</ul>
<p>if the duplex settings do not match</p>
<ul>
<li>the switch interface will still be in a connected (up/up) or connected state.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to identify duplex mismatch problems,</p>
<ul>
<li>check the duplex setting on each end of the link to see if the values mismatch.</li>
<li>watch for incrementing collision and late collision counters</li>
</ul>
<p>Common Layer 1 problems</p>
<ul>
<li>receiving device might receive a frame whose bits have changed values.</li>
<li>These frames do not pass the error detection logic as implemented in the FCS field in the Ethernet trailer,</li>
<li>The receiving device discards the frame and counts it as some kind of input error.</li>
<li>Cisco switches list this error as a CRC error</li>
</ul>
<p>Runts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Frames that did not meet the minimum frame size requirement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(64 bytes, including the 18-byte destination MAC, source MAC, type, and FCS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be caused by collisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Giants:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Frames that exceed the maximum frame size requirement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(1518 bytes, including the 18-byte destination MAC, source MAC, type, and FCS)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Input Errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>A total of many counters, including runts, giants, no buffer, CRC, frame, overrun, and ignored counts.</li>
</ul>
<p>CRC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Received frames that did not pass the FCS math</li>
<li>can be caused by collisions</li>
</ul>
<p>Frame:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Received frames that have an illegal format</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(like ending with a partial byte)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can be caused by collisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Packets Output:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total number of packets (frames) forwarded out the interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Output Errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total number of packets (frames) that the switch port tried to transmit, but for which some problem occurred.</li>
</ul>
<p>Collisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter of all collisions that occur when the interface is transmitting a frame</li>
</ul>
<p>Late Collisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The subset of all collisions that happen after the 64th byte</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(In a properly working Ethernet LAN, collisions should occur within the first 64 bytes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Often point to a duplex mismatch</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Collisions occur as a normal part of the half-duplex logic imposed by CSMA/CD</p>
<p>a switch interface with an increasing collisions counter might not even have a problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>if the CRC errors grow, but the collisions counters do not, the problem might simply be interference on the cable.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="switchport-security-configuration">Switchport Security Configuration</h1>

<p>5.0 Security Fundamentals</p>
<p>5.7 Configure Layer 2 security features (DHCP snooping, dynamic ARP inspection, and port security)</p>
<p>Port Security Concepts and Configuration</p>
<ul>
<li>identifies devices based on the source MAC address of Ethernet frames that the devices send.</li>
<li>no restrictions on whether the frame came from a local device or was forwarded through other switches</li>
<li>examines frames received on the interface to determine if a violation has occurred.</li>
<li>defines a maximum number of unique source MAC addresses allowed for all frames coming in the interface.</li>
<li>keeps a list and counter of all unique source MAC addresses on the interface.</li>
<li>monitors newly learned MAC addresses, considering those MAC addresses to cause a violation if the newly learned MAC address would push the total number of MAC table entries for the interface past the configured maximum allowed MAC addresses for that port.</li>
<li>takes action to discard frames from the violating MAC addresses, plus other actions depending on the configured violation mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other port security options</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a maximum of three MAC addresses, defining all three specific MAC addresses.</li>
<li>Define a maximum of three MAC addresses but allow those addresses to be dynamically learned, allowing the first three MAC addresses learned.</li>
<li>Define a maximum of three MAC addresses, predefining one specific MAC address, and allowing two more to be dynamically learned.</li>
</ul>
<p>sticky secure MAC addresses.</p>
<ul>
<li>port security learns the MAC addresses off each port so that you do not have to preconfigure the values. It also adds the learned MAC addresses to the port security configuration (in the running-config file).</li>
</ul>
<p>Configuring Port Security</p>
<ul>
<li>works on both access ports and trunk ports</li>
</ul>
<p>requires you to statically configure the port as a trunk or an access port.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the switchport mode access or the switchport mode trunk interface subcommands</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the switchport port-security interface subcommand to enable port security on the interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Optional)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>switchport port-security maximum number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>override the default maximum number of allowed MAC addresses associated with the interface (1).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Optional)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>switchport port-security violation {protect | restrict | shutdown}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>override the default action to take upon a security violation (shutdown).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Optional)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>switchport port-security mac-address mac-address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>predefine any allowed source MAC addresses for this interface.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Optional)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>switchport port-security mac-address sticky</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tell the switch to “sticky learn” dynamically learned MAC addresses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>switchport port-security</p>
<ul>
<li>enables port security, with all defaults</li>
</ul>
<p>switchport port-security mac-address 0200.1111.1111</p>
<ul>
<li>defines a specific source MAC address. With the default maximum source address setting of 1</li>
</ul>
<p>default violation action</p>
<p>disable the interface.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Port security does not save the configuration of the sticky addresses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use the copy running-config startup-config command if desired.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>voice ports and EtherChannels</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>voice ports</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make sure to configure the maximum MAC address to at least two (one for the phone, or for a PC connected to the phone)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EtherChannels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the port security configuration should be placed on the port-channel interface, rather than the individual physical interfaces in the channel.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Verifying Port Security</p>
<p>Show port-security interface</p>
<ul>
<li>

<p>Problem Isolation Using the ping Command</p>
<p>functions as part of Layer 3, as a control protocol to assist IP by helping manage the IP network functions.</p>
<p>Ping options</p>
<p>The name or IP address of the destination,</p>
<p>how many times the command should send an echo request,</p>
<p>how long the command should wait (timeout) for an echo reply,</p>
<p>how big to make the packets, and many other options.</p>
<p>Extended ping allows R1’s ping command to use R1’s LAN IP address from within subnet 172.16.1.0/24.</p>
<p>This same command could have been issued from the command line as ping 172.16.2.101 source 172.16.1.1.</p>
<p>R1# ping</p>
<p>Protocol [ip]:</p>
<p>Target IP address: 172.16.2.101</p>
<p>Repeat count [5]:</p>
<p>Datagram size [100]:</p>
<p>Timeout in seconds [2]:</p>
<p>Extended commands [n]: y</p>
<p>Source address or interface: 172.16.1.1</p>
<p>Type of service [0]:</p>
<p>Set DF bit in IP header? [no]:</p>
<p>Validate reply data? [no]:</p>
<p>Data pattern [0xABCD]:</p>
<p>Loose, Strict, Record, Timestamp, Verbose[none]:</p>
<p>Sweep range of sizes [n]:</p>
<p>Type escape sequence to abort.</p>
<p>Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 172.16.2.101, timeout is 2 seconds:</p>
<p>Packet sent with a source address of 172.16.1.1</p>
<p>!!!!!</p>
<p>Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 1/2/4 ms</p>
<p>Problems to test. ( ping from router or from host?)</p>
<ul>
<li>IP ACLs that discard packets based on host A’s IP address but allow packets that match the router’s IP address</li>
<li>LAN switch port security that filters A’s frames (based on A’s MAC address)</li>
<li>IP routes on routers that happen to match host A’s 172.16.1.51 address, with different routes that match R1’s 172.16.1.1 address</li>
<li>Problems with host A’s default router setting</li>
</ul>
<p>If the ping works, it confirms the following, which rules out some potential issues:</p>
<p>The host with address 172.16.1.51 replied.</p>
<p>The LAN can pass unicast frames from R1 to host 172.16.1.51 and vice versa.</p>
<p>You can reasonably assume that the switches learned the MAC addresses of the router and the host, adding those to the MAC address tables.</p>
<p>Host A and Router R1 completed the ARP process and list each other in their respective Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) tables.</p>
<ul>
<li>IP addressing problem: Host A could be statically configured with the wrong IP address.</li>
<li>DHCP problems: If you are using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), many problems could exist. </li>
<li>VLAN trunking problems: The router could be configured for 802.1Q trunking, when the switch is not (or vice versa).</li>
<li>LAN problems: A wide variety of issues could exist with the Layer 2 switches, preventing any frames from flowing between host A and the router.</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing LAN Neighbors with Extended Ping</p>
<p>an extended ping can test the host’s default router setting. Both tests can be useful, especially for problem isolation, because</p>
<ul>
<li>If a standard ping of a local LAN host works…</li>
<li>But an extended ping of the same LAN host fails…</li>
<li>The problem likely relates somehow to the host’s default router setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing WAN Neighbors with Standard Ping</p>
<p>A successful ping of the IP address on the other end of an Ethernet WAN link that sits between two routers confirms several specific facts, such as the following:</p>
<p>Both routers’ WAN interfaces are in an up/up state.</p>
<p>The Layer 1 and 2 features of the link work.</p>
<p>The routers believe that the neighboring router’s IP address is in the same subnet.</p>
<p>Inbound ACLs on both routers do not filter the incoming packets, respectively.</p>
<p>The remote router is configured with the expected IP address (172.16.4.2 in this case).</p>
<p>Using Ping with Names and with IP Addresses</p>
<p>Problem Isolation Using the traceroute Command</p>
<p>ping vs Tracert</p>
<ul>
<li>Both send messages in the network to test connectivity.</li>
<li>Both rely on other devices to send back a reply.</li>
<li>Both have wide support on many different operating systems.</li>
<li>Both can use a hostname or an IP address to identify the destination.</li>
<li>On routers, both have a standard and extended version, allowing better testing of the reverse route.</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard and Extended traceroute</p>
<p>a standard traceroute command chooses an IP address based on the outgoing interface for the packet sent by the command. So, in this example, the packets sent by R1 come from source IP address 172.16.4.1, R1’s G0/0/0 IP address.</p>
<p>Host OS traceroute commands usually create ICMP echo requests. The Cisco IOS traceroute command instead creates IP packets with a UDP header. This bit of information may seem trivial at this point. However, note that an ACL may actually filter the traffic from a host’s traceroute messages but not the router traceroute command, or vice versa.</p>

<h1 id="vlans">VLANs</h1>

<h2 id="virtual-lan-vlan-concepts">Virtual LAN (VLAN) Concepts</h2>
<p>Using VLANs creates smaller broadcast domains. There are many reasons why you would want to do this. You reduce CPU overhead on each device. And reduce security risks by using different security policies on each VLAN.</p>
<p>You can also use more flexible designs that group users by department instead of by physical location. Using VLANs helps you solve problems more quickly. As the failure point for many problems would include devices in a single broadcast domain.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>supports a theoretical maximum of 212 (4096) VLANs, but in practice it supports a maximum of 4094.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both 802.1Q and ISL use 12 bits to tag the VLAN ID, with two reserved values [0 and 4095].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>802.1q header includes Type, priority, Flag, Vlan ID</p>
</li>

Description
Two customer premise equip-
ment (CPE) devices can ex-
change Ethernet frames, simi-
lar in concept to a leased line.
This service acts like a LAN, in
that all devices can send
frames to all other devices.
A central site can communicate
to a defined set of remote sites,
but the remote sites cannot
communicate directly. &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>E-Line (point-to-point), E-LAN (full mesh), and E-Tree (point-to-multipoint, hub and spoke)</p>
<p>Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) used for what MEF defines as E-Line service, and Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) used for what MEF defines as E-LAN service and Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS) refer to cases in which the SP uses MPLS internally to create what the customer sees as an Ethernet WAN service.</p>
<h3 id="ethernet-line-service-point-to-point">Ethernet Line Service (Point-to-Point)</h3>
<p>The customer connects two sites with access links. Then the MetroE service allows the two customer devices to send Ethernet frames to each other.</p>

<p>a WAN service that routes IP packets between customer sites</p>
<p>the middle four routers could represent the SP’s MPLS network, with the numbered routers on the edges being routers owned by one company.</p>
<p>the SP builds its IP network to also use Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), in particular MPLS VPNs</p>
<p>allow the SP to build one large MPLS network, which also creates a private IP-based WAN for each of its customers.</p>
<p>The routers on the edge of the MPLS network add and remove an MPLS header to packets as they enter and exit the MPLS network. The devices inside the MPLS network then use the label field inside that MPLS header when forwarding data across the MPLS network. The choices of the labels to use, along with other related logic, allow the MPLS VPN to create separate VPNs to keep different customers’ traffic separate.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Will learn customer subnets/routes with those routing protocols</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will advertise a customer’s routes with a routing protocol so that all routers that customer connects to the MPLS VPN can learn all routes as advertised through the MPLS VPN network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will make decisions about MPLS VPN forwarding, including what MPLS labels to add and remove, based on the customer’s IP address space and customer IP routes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>MPLS VPNs create a private network by keeping customer data separate, but not by encrypting the data.</p>

<p>the enterprise will want to work with the SP to define other features of the service. The customer and SP will need to work through the details of some Layer 3 design choices (as discussed in more depth in the next section). The customer will also likely want to ask for QoS services from the MPLS provider and define those details.</p>
<h3 id="layer-3-with-mpls-vpn">Layer 3 with MPLS VPN</h3>
<p>MPLS must be aware of the customer IP addressing. The SP will even use routing protocols and advertise those customer routes across the WAN</p>
<p>CE routers need to exchange routes with the PE routers in the MPLS network. Additionally, all the CE routers need to learn routes from the other CE routers—a process that relies on the PE routers.</p>
<p>MPLS allows for many familiar routing protocols on the edge of the MPLS network: RIPv2, EIGRP, OSPF, and even eBGP</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The MPLS network does advertise the customer’s routes between the various PE routers so that the CE routers can learn all customer routes through their PE-CE routing protocol neighbor relationship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To advertise the customer routes between the PE routers, the PE routers use another routing protocol along with a process called route redistribution. Route redistribution happens inside one router, taking routes from one routing protocol process and injecting them into another. MPLS does route redistribution in the PE routers between the routing protocol used by the customer and a variation of BGP called Multiprotocol BGP (MPBGP). (Redistribution is needed when the PE-CE routing protocol is not BGP.</p>

<p>Internet VPN Fundamentals</p>
<p>Internet VPNs can provide important security features, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Confidentiality (privacy): Preventing anyone in the middle of the Internet (man in the middle) from being able to read the data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authentication: Verifying that the sender of the VPN packet is a legitimate device and not a device used by an attacker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data integrity: Verifying that the packet was not changed as the packet transited the Internet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anti-replay: Preventing a man in the middle from copying and later replaying the packets sent by a legitimate user, for the purpose of appearing to be a legitimate user</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Host PC1 (10.2.2.2) on the right sends a packet to the web server (10.1.1.1), just as it would without a VPN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The router encrypts the packet, adds some VPN headers, adds another IP header (with public IP addresses), and forwards the packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An attacker in the Internet copies the packet (called a man-in-the-middle attack). However, the attacker cannot change the packet without being noticed and cannot read the contents of the original packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firewall FW1 receives the packet, confirms the authenticity of the sender, confirms that the packet has not been changed, and then decrypts the original packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server S1 receives the unencrypted packet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>tunnel refers to any protocol’s packet that is sent by encapsulating the packet inside another packet. The term VPN tunnel may or may not imply that the tunnel also uses encryption.</p>
<p>Site-to-Site VPNs with Ipsec</p>
<p>an architecture or framework for security services for IP networks</p>
<p>more generally called IP Security</p>
<p>IPsec defines how two devices, both of which connect to the Internet, can achieve the main goals of a VPN as listed at the beginning of this section: confidentiality, authentication, data integrity, and anti-replay</p>
<p>its role as an architecture allows it to be added to and changed over time as improvements to individual security functions are made.</p>
<p>IPsec encryption uses a pair of encryption algorithms, which are essentially math formulas, to meet a couple of requirements</p>
<p>One to hide (encrypt) the data</p>
<p>Another to re-create (decrypt) the original data based on the encrypted data</p>
<p>if an attacker did happen to decrypt one packet, that information would not give the attacker any advantages in decrypting the other packets.</p>
<p>process for encrypting data for an IPsec VPN</p>
<p>the encryption key is also known as the session key, shared key, or shared session key.</p>
<p>Session Key
F&rsquo; (Encrypted-data, Session-key)
Original
IP Packet
Clear-text Data
Sending Host
Session Key

F(IP Packet, Session-key) Encrypted Data
IP Header VPN Header Encrypted Data</p>
<p>The sending device encapsulates the encrypted data into a packet, which includes the new IP header and VPN header.</p>
<p>The receiving VPN device runs the corresponding decryption formula, using the encrypted data and session key—the same key value as was used on the sending VPN device—to decrypt the data.</p>
<p>devices use some related VPN technology like Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) to create the concept of a tunnel (a virtual link between the routers),</p>
<p>Without IPsec, each GRE tunnel could be used to forward unencrypted traffic over the Internet. IPsec adds the security features to the data that flows over the tunnel</p>
<p>the figure shows IPsec and GRE, but IPsec teams with other VPN technologies as well</p>
<p>RI

Access Technology</p>
<p>Remote Access VPNs with TLS</p>
<p>remote access VPNs often use the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to create a secure VPN session.</p>
<p>TLS provides the security features of HTTP Secure (HTTPS). Today’s web browsers support HTTPS (with TLS) as a way to dynamically create a secure connection from the web browser to a web server,</p>
<p>To do so, the browser creates a TCP connection to server well-known port 443 (default) and then initializes a TLS session. TLS encrypts data sent between the browser and the server and authenticating the user. Then, the HTTP messages flow over the TLS VPN connection.</p>
<p>SSL has been deprecated (see RFC 7568) and has been replaced by TLS.</p>
<p>each session secures only the data sent in that session</p>
<p>can be used to create a client VPN that secures all packets from the device to a site by using a Cisco VPN client</p>
<p>Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client (or AnyConnect Client for short) is software that sits on a user’s PC and uses TLS to create one end of a VPN remote-access tunnel</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-vlan">What is a VLAN?</h1>

<p>VLANs create smaller broadcast domains. Why create smaller broadcast domains?</p>
<ul>
<li>Device have to do less stuff (process less broadcasts)</li>
<li>Better security</li>
<li>Group different departments together</li>
<li>Narrow down problems</li>
<li>Less spanning tree if you reduce vlan to a single switch</li>
</ul>
<p>802.1q tagging</p>
<p>Frames are tagged with an 802.1q header as they leave the switch. So the receiving switch knows what vlan the frame is part of.</p>
<p>802.1q header</p>
<ul>
<li>4 bytes</li>
<li>Includes 12 bit vlan id field that supports 4096 vlans. (0 and 5 are reserved so make that 4094)</li>
<li>Also include type, priority, and flag fields</li>
</ul>
<p>VLAN numbers and what they mean</p>
<p>Normal range vlans are vlans 1-1005. All switches are able to use these vlan numbers.</p>
<p>Extended range vlans 1006-4094. Only some switches are able to use these</p>
<p>Native vlan are untagged. This is important. The native vlans is defaulted to 1. But you can manually set it to another number say vlan4.</p>
<p>VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)</p>
<p>This is a protocol for spreading VLAN settings throughout a network. A switch can be set to Transparent, client, or server.</p>
<p>Client mode: Cannot configure vlans and can learn new and deleted vlans from other switches.</p>
<p>Server Mode: Can configure VLANS is the standard range. Can learn new and deleted vlans from other switches.</p>
<p>VTP Commands:</p>
<p>Set the vtp mode</p>
<p>#vtp mode (transparent, client, server, off)</p>
<p>Show vtp settings</p>
<p>#show vtp status</p>
<p>Dynamic trunking protocol</p>
<p>Will negotiate ISL or 802.1q trunking with other switches</p>
<p>Switches will default to ISL if they both know that protocol. Otherwise they will use DTP if they both support it. This is because the default setting reads “negotiate”. Or negotiate the protocol used.</p>
<p>You should disable negotiation of trunks for better security.</p>
<p>Switchport settings for DTP</p>
<p>Access: Statically set as access</p>
<p>Trunk: statically set as trunk</p>
<p>Dynamic desirable: Initiates and responds to negotiation messages.</p>
<p>Dynamic auto: responds to negotiation messages only. This is the default setting. If both ends use dynamic auto mode then both ends will be configured as access ports. If the other end is set as Dynamic desirable, then both ports will be set as trunk ports.</p>
<p>Trunking commands:</p>
<p>Setting the encapsulation mode</p>
<p>#switchport trunk encapsulation (dot1q | isl | negotiate)</p>
<p>Disable DTP</p>
<p>#switchport no negotiate</p>
<p>Voice vlans</p>
<p>Only time you can configure two vlans on an access port is if you add a voice vlan to it. This is because phones are often on the same port as user pcs and voice traffic is often prioritized differently than other traffic.</p>
<p>CDP protocol must be enabled for voic vlan to work. Also, voice traffic is tagged with an 802.1q header.</p>
<p>Setting the voice vlan</p>
<p>#switchport voice vlan 12</p>
<p>Showing vlan information and troubleshooting</p>
<p>You will want to see what vlans are configured on what ports. What trunks are allowed on what ports. Verify VTP and DTP settings, etc.</p>
<p>Show trunk info</p>
<p>#Show interfaces interface-id trunk</p>
<p>Choose what vlans are allowed on a trunk</p>
<p># Switchport trunk allowed vlan</p>

<h1 id="what-to-learn-after-ccna">What to Learn After CCNA</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed with options after completing your CCNA. What do you learn next? If you are trying to get a job as a Network Engineer, you will want to check this out.</p>
<p>I went through dozens of job listings that mentioned CCNA. Then, tallied up the main devices/vendors, certifications, and technologies mentioned. And left out anything that wasn&rsquo;t mentioned more than twice.</p>
<p>Core CCNA technologies such as LAN, WAN, OSPF, Spanning Tree, VLANs, etc. have been left out. The point here is to target the most sought after technologies and skills by employers. I also left out soft skills and any job that wasn&rsquo;t a networking specific role.</p>
<h2 id="devices-vendors">Devices/ Vendors</h2>
<p>Palo Alto is huge! I&rsquo;m not suprised by this. Depending on the company, a network engineer may be responsible for firewall configuration and troubleshooting. It also looks like Network Engineers with a wide variety of skills are saught after.</p>

<p>Pick something that interests you and go for it. That is the only way to get it right. Doing what you enjoy is better than not doing anything at all because you can&rsquo;t decide the best path.</p>
<p>Hopefully we can revisit this post after learning Python to get a much bigger sample size.</p>

<h1 id="wireless-architectures">Wireless Architectures</h1>

<p>This chapter covers the following exam topics:</p>
<p>2.0 Network Access</p>
<p>2.6 Compare Cisco Wireless Architectures and AP modes</p>
<p>Autonomous AP Architecture</p>
<p>VLANs must be trunked from the distribution layer switch (where routing commonly takes place) to the access layer, where they are extended further over a trunk link to the AP.</p>
<p>Two wireless users that are associated to the same autonomous AP can reach each other through the AP without having to pass up into the wired network</p>
<p>An autonomous AP must also be configured with a management IP address so that you can remotely manage it.</p>
<p>configure SSIDs, VLANs, and many RF parameters like the channel and transmit power to be used.</p>
<p>management address is not normally part of any of the data VLANs, so a dedicated management VLAN (i.e., VLAN 10) must be added to the trunk links to reach the AP.</p>
<p>Each AP must be configured and maintained individually unless you leverage a management platform such as Cisco Prime Infrastructure or Cisco DNA Center.</p>
<p>That might sound straightforward until you have to add a new VLAN and configure every switch and AP in your network to carry and support it.</p>
<p>Cloud-based AP Architecture</p>
<p>Cisco Meraki is cloud-based and offers centralized management of wireless, switched, and security networks built from Meraki products. For example, through the cloud networking service, you can configure and manage APs, monitor wireless performance and activity, generate reports, and so on.</p>
<p>Cisco Meraki APs can be deployed automatically, once you register with the Meraki cloud. Each AP will contact the cloud when it powers up and will self-configure. From that point on, you can manage the AP through the Meraki cloud dashboard.</p>
<p>From the cloud, you can push out code upgrades and configuration changes to the APs in the enterprise</p>
<p>adds the intelligence needed to automatically instruct each AP on which channel and transmit power level to use.</p>
<p>Can also collect information from all of the APs about things such as RF interference, rogue or unexpected wireless devices that were overheard, and wireless usage statistics.</p>
<p>The data path from the wireless network to the wired network is very short; the autonomous AP links the two networks. Data to and from wireless clients does not have to travel up into the cloud and back; the cloud is used to bring management functions into the data plane.</p>
<p>the network in Figure 27-3 consists of two distinct paths—one for data traffic and another for management traffic, corresponding to the following two functions:</p>

<p>A control plane: Traffic used to control, configure, manage, and monitor the AP itself</p>
<p>A data plane: End-user traffic passing through the AP</p>
<p>Split-MAC Architectures</p>
<p>The real-time processes involve sending and receiving 802.11 frames, beacons, and probe messages. 802.11 data encryption is also handled in real time, on a per-packet basis. The AP must interact with wireless clients on some low level, known as the Media Access Control (MAC) layer. These functions must stay with the AP hardware, closest to the clients.</p>
<p>The management functions are not integral to handling frames over the RF channels, but are things that should be centrally administered. Therefore, those functions can be moved to a centrally located platform away from the AP.</p>
<p>When the functions of an autonomous AP are divided, the AP hardware is known as a lightweight access point, and performs only the real-time 802.11 operation.</p>
<p>the AP is left with duties in Layers 1 and 2, where frames are moved into and out of the RF domain. The AP becomes totally dependent on the WLC for every other WLAN function, such as authenticating users, managing security policies, and even selecting RF channels and output power.</p>
<p>The lightweight AP-WLC division of labor is known as a split-MAC architecture, where the normal MAC operations are pulled apart into two distinct locations.</p>
<p>the AP and WLC can be located on the same VLAN or IP subnet, but they do not have to be</p>
<p>CAPWAP relationship actually consists of two separate tunnels, as follows:</p>
<p>CAPWAP control messages: Carries exchanges that are used to configure the AP and manage its operation. The control messages are authenticated and encrypted, so the AP is securely controlled by only the appropriate WLC, then transported over the control tunnel.</p>
<p>CAPWAP data: Used for packets traveling to and from wireless clients that are associated with the AP. Data packets are transported over the data tunnel but are not encrypted by default. When data encryption is enabled for an AP, packets are protected with Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).</p>
<p>Every AP and WLC must also authenticate each other with digital certificates. An X.509 certificate is preinstalled in each device when it is purchased.</p>
<p>Notice how VLAN 100 exists at the WLC and in the air as SSID 100, near the wireless clients—but not in between the AP and the WLC</p>
<p>Because the AP sits on the access layer where its CAPWAP tunnels terminate, it can use one IP address for both management and tunneling. No trunk link is needed because all of the VLANs it supports are encapsulated and tunneled as Layer 3 IP packets, rather than individual Layer 2 VLANs.</p>
<p>As the wireless network grows, the WLC simply builds more CAPWAP tunnels to reach more Aps</p>
<p>WLC can begin offering a variety of additional functions:</p>
<p>Dynamic channel assignment: The WLC can automatically choose and configure the RF channel used by each AP, based on other active access points in the area.</p>
<p>Transmit power optimization: The WLC can automatically set the transmit power of each AP based on the coverage area needed.</p>
<p>Self-healing wireless coverage: If an AP radio dies, the coverage hole can be “healed” by turning up the transmit power of surrounding APs automatically.</p>
<p>Flexible client roaming: Clients can roam between APs with very fast roaming times.</p>
<p>Dynamic client load balancing: If two or more APs are positioned to cover the same geographic area, the WLC can associate clients with the least used AP. This distributes the client load across the APs.</p>
<p>RF monitoring: The WLC manages each AP so that it scans channels to monitor the RF usage. By listening to a channel, the WLC can remotely gather information about RF interference, noise, signals from neighboring APs, and signals from rogue APs or ad hoc clients.</p>
<p>Security management: The WLC can authenticate clients from a central service and can require wireless clients to obtain an IP address from a trusted DHCP server before allowing them to associate and access the WLAN.</p>
<p>Wireless intrusion protection system: Leveraging its central location, the WLC can monitor client data to detect and prevent malicious activity.</p>
<p>Comparing Wireless LAN Controller Deployments</p>
<p>locate the WLC in a central location so that you can maximize the number of APs joined to it. This is usually called a unified or centralized WLC deployment</p>
<p>Typical unified WLCs can support a maximum of 6000 APs</p>
<p>A WLC can also be located in a central position in the network, inside a data center in a private cloud, as shown in Figure 27-9. This is known as a cloud-based WLC deployment, where the WLC exists as a virtual machine rather than a physical device.</p>
<p>Such a controller can typically support up to 3000 APs.</p>
<p>For small campuses or distributed branch locations, where the number of APs is relatively small in each, the WLC can be co-located with a stack of switches, as shown in Figure 27-10. This is known as an embedded WLC deployment</p>
<p>Typical Cisco embedded WLCs can support up to 200 APs. The APs do not necessarily have to be connected to the switches that host the WLC</p>
<p>the WLC function can be co-located with an AP that is installed at the branch site. This is known as a Cisco Mobility Express WLC deployment</p>
<p>A Mobility Express WLC can support up to 100 APs.</p>
<p>Cisco AP Modes</p>
<p>WLC, you can also configure a lightweight AP to operate in one of the following special-purpose modes:</p>
<p>Local: The default lightweight mode that offers one or more functioning BSSs on a specific channel. During times that it is not transmitting, the AP will scan the other channels to measure the level of noise, measure interference, discover rogue devices, and match against intrusion detection system (IDS) events.</p>
<p>Monitor: The AP does not transmit at all, but its receiver is enabled to act as a dedicated sensor. The AP checks for IDS events, detects rogue access points, and determines the position of stations through location-based services.</p>
<p>FlexConnect: An AP at a remote site can locally switch traffic between an SSID and a VLAN if its CAPWAP tunnel to the WLC is down and if it is configured to do so.</p>
<p>Sniffer: An AP dedicates its radios to receiving 802.11 traffic from other sources, much like a sniffer or packet capture device. The captured traffic is then forwarded to a PC running network analyzer software such as Wildpackets OmniPeek or WireShark, where it can be analyzed further.</p>
<p>Rogue detector: An AP dedicates itself to detecting rogue devices by correlating MAC addresses heard on the wired network with those heard over the air. Rogue devices are those that appear on both networks.</p>
<p>Bridge: An AP becomes a dedicated bridge (point-to-point or point-to-multipoint) between two networks. Two APs in bridge mode can be used to link two locations separated by a distance. Multiple APs in bridge mode can form an indoor or outdoor mesh network.</p>
<p>Flex+Bridge: FlexConnect operation is enabled on a mesh AP.</p>
<p>SE-Connect: The AP dedicates its radios to spectrum analysis on all wireless channels. You can remotely connect a PC running software such as MetaGeek Chanalyzer or Cisco Spectrum Expert to the AP to collect and analyze the spectrum analysis data to discover sources of interference.</p>
<p>Remember that a lightweight AP is normally in local mode when it is providing BSSs and allowing client devices to associate to wireless LANs. When an AP is configured to operate in one of the other modes, local mode (and the BSSs) is disabled.</p>

<p>Connecting a Cisco WLC</p>
<p>Cisco wireless controllers differ a bit; ports and interfaces refer to different concepts.</p>
<p>Controller ports are physical connections made to an external wired or switched network, whereas interfaces are logical connections made internally within the controller</p>
<p>Using WLC Ports</p>
<p>Service port: Used for out-of-band management, system recovery, and initial boot functions; always connects to a switch port in access mode</p>
<p>Distribution system port: Used for all normal AP and management traffic; usually connects to a switch port in 802.1Q trunk mode</p>
<p>Console port: Used for out-of-band management, system recovery, and initial boot functions; asynchronous connection to a terminal emulator (9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, by default)</p>
<p>Redundancy port: Used to connect to a peer controller for high availability (HA) operation</p>
<p>Controllers can have a single service port that must be connected to a switched network. Usually, the service port is assigned to a management VLAN so that you can access the controller with SSH or a web browser to perform initial configuration or for maintenance. Notice that the service port supports only a single VLAN, so the corresponding switch port must be configured for access mode only.</p>
<p>Controllers also have multiple distribution system ports that you must connect to the network. These ports carry most of the data coming to and going from the controller. For example, the CAPWAP tunnels (control and data) that extend to each of a controller’s APs pass across the distribution system ports. Client data also passes from wireless LANs to wired VLANs over the ports. In addition, any management traffic using a web browser, SSH, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), and so on, normally reaches the controller in-band through the ports.</p>
<p>the distribution system ports always operate in 802.1Q trunking mode.</p>
<p>The distribution system ports can operate independently, each one transporting multiple VLANs to a unique group of internal controller interfaces. For resiliency, you can configure distribution system ports in redundant pairs. One port is primarily used; if it fails, a backup port is used instead.</p>
<p>Controller distribution system ports can be configured as a link aggregation group (LAG) such that they are bundled together to act as one larger link</p>
<p>traffic can be load-balanced across the individual ports that make up the LAG</p>
<p>LAG offers resiliency; if one individual port fails, traffic will be redirected to the remaining working ports instead.</p>
<p>Cisco WLCs do not support any link aggregation negotiation protocol, like LACP or PAgP, at all.</p>
<p>Using WLC Interfaces</p>
<p>the controller must somehow map those wired VLANs to equivalent logical wireless networks</p>
<p>VLAN must be connected to a unique wireless LAN that exists on a controller and its associated APs.</p>
<p>Cisco wireless controllers provide the necessary connectivity through internal logical interfaces, which must be configured with an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Each interface is then assigned to a physical port and a VLAN ID. You can think of an interface as a Layer 3 termination on a VLAN.</p>
<p>Cisco controllers support the following interface types:</p>
<p>Management interface: Used for normal management traffic, such as RADIUS user authentication, WLC-to-WLC communication, web-based and SSH sessions, SNMP, Network Time Protocol (NTP), syslog, and so on. The management interface is also used to terminate CAPWAP tunnels between the controller and its APs.</p>
<p>Redundancy management: The management IP address of a redundant WLC that is part of a high availability pair of controllers. The active WLC uses the management interface address, while the standby WLC uses the redundancy management address.</p>
<p>Virtual interface: IP address facing wireless clients when the controller is relaying client DHCP requests, performing client web authentication, and supporting client mobility.</p>
<p>Service port interface: Bound to the service port and used for out-of-band management.</p>
<p>Dynamic interface: Used to connect a VLAN to a WLAN.</p>

<p>The management interface faces the switched network, where management users and APs are located. Management traffic will usually consist of protocols like HTTPS, SSH, SNMP, NTP, TFTP, and so on</p>
<p>consists of CAPWAP packets that carry control and data tunnels to and from the APs.</p>
<p>The virtual interface is used only for certain client-facing operations.</p>
<p>when a wireless client issues a request to obtain an IP address, the controller can relay the request on to an actual DHCP server that can provide the appropriate IP address</p>
<p>DHCP server appears to be the controller’s virtual interface address. Clients may see the virtual interface’s address, but that address is never used when the controller communicates with other devices on the switched network.</p>
<p>Because the virtual interface is used only for some client management functions, you should configure it with a unique, nonroutable address. For example, you might use 10.1.1.1 because it is within a private address space defined in RFC 1918.</p>
<p>The virtual interface address is also used to support client mobility.</p>
<p>every controller that exists in the same mobility group should be configured with a virtual address that is identical to the others. By using one common virtual address, all the controllers will appear to operate as a cluster as clients roam from controller to controller.</p>
<p>Dynamic interfaces map WLANs to VLANs,</p>
<p>making the logical connections between wireless and wired networks. You will configure one dynamic interface for each wireless LAN that is offered by the controller’s APs and then map the interface to the WLAN.</p>
<p>Each dynamic interface must also be configured with its own IP address and can act as a DHCP relay for wireless clients. To filter traffic passing through a dynamic interface, you can configure an optional access list.</p>

<p>The controller will bind the WLAN to one of its interfaces and then push the WLAN configuration out to all of its APs by default.</p>
<p>Like VLANs, you can use WLANs to segregate wireless users and their traffic into logical networks. Users associated with one WLAN cannot cross over into another one unless their traffic is bridged or routed from one VLAN to another through the wired network infrastructure.</p>
<p>Cisco controllers support a maximum of 512 WLANs, but only 16 of them can be actively configured on an AP.</p>
<p>Advertising each WLAN to potential wireless clients uses up valuable airtime.</p>
<p>Every AP must broadcast beacon management frames at regular intervals to advertise the existence of a BSS</p>
<p>Beacons are normally sent 10 times per second, or once every 100 ms, at the lowest mandatory data rate</p>
<p>if you create too many WLANs, a channel can be starved of any usable airtime</p>
<p>always limit the number of WLANs to five or fewer; a maximum of three WLANs is best</p>
<p>Before you create a new WLAN, think about the following parameters it will need to have:</p>
<p>SSID string</p>
<p>Controller interface and VLAN number</p>
<p>Type of wireless security needed</p>
<p>you will create the appropriate dynamic controller interface to support the new WLAN; then you will enter the necessary WLAN parameters</p>

Be sure to set the server status to Enabled so that the controller can begin using it. At the bottom of the page, you can select the type of user that will be authenticated with the server. Check Network User to authenticate wireless clients or Management to authenticate wireless administrators that will access the controller’s management functions.

<p>Step 3. Create a New WLAN</p>
<p>selecting WLANs from the top menu bar (displays current WLANs)</p>
<p>You can create a new WLAN by selecting Create New from the drop-down menu and then clicking the Go button.</p>
<p>Next, enter a descriptive name as the profile name and the SSID text string.</p>
<p>The ID number is used as an index into the list of WLANs that are defined on the controller. The ID number becomes useful when you use templates in Prime Infrastructure (PI) to configure WLANs on multiple controllers at the same time.</p>

<p>WLAN templates are applied to specific WLAN ID numbers on controllers. The WLAN ID is only locally significant and is not passed between controllers. As a rule, you should keep the sequence of WLAN names and IDs consistent across multiple controllers so that any configuration templates you use in the future will be applied to the same WLANs on each controller.</p>
<p>Click the Apply button to create the new WLAN. The next page will allow you to edit four categories of parameters, corresponding to the tabs across the top</p>
<p>WLANS •Enginering</p>
<p>You can control whether the WLAN is enabled or disabled with the Status check box</p>
<p>Under Radio Policy, select the type of radio that will offer the WLAN. By default, the WLAN will be offered on all radios that are joined with the controller. You can select a more specific policy with 802.11a only, 802.11a/g only, 802.11g only, or 802.11b/g only.</p>
<p>Next, select which of the controller’s dynamic interfaces will be bound to the WLAN. By default, the management interface is selected. The drop-down list contains all the interface names that are available</p>
<p>Finally, use the Broadcast SSID check box to select whether the APs should broadcast the SSID name in the beacons they transmit.</p>
<p>Hiding the SSID name, by not broadcasting it, does not really provide any worthwhile security</p>
<p>Configuring WLAN Security</p>
<p>Select the Security tab to configure the security settings. By default, the Layer 2 Security tab is selected. From the Layer 2 Security drop-down menu, select the appropriate security scheme to use. Table 29-2 lists the types that are available.</p>

<p>To use WPA2-Enterprise, the 802.1X option would be selected. In that case, 802.1x and EAP would be used to authenticate wireless clients against one or more RADIUS servers.</p>
<p>To specify which servers the WLAN should use, you would select the Security tab and then the AAA Servers tab in the WLAN edit screen. You can identify up to six specific RADIUS servers in the WLAN configuration. Beside each server, select a specific server IP address from the drop-down menu of globally defined servers.

<p>This chapter covers the following exam topics:</p>
<p>1.0 Network Fundamentals</p>
<p>1.1 Explain the role and function of network components</p>
<p>1.1.d Access Points</p>
<p>1.11 Describe wireless principles</p>
<p>1.11.a Nonoverlapping Wi-Fi channels</p>
<p>1.11.b SSID</p>
<p>1.11.c RF</p>
<p>Comparing Wired and Wireless Networks</p>
<p>Wireless devices must adhere to a common standard (IEEE 802.11).</p>
<p>Wireless coverage must exist in the area where devices are expected to use it.</p>
<p>Wireless LAN Topologies</p>
<p>IEEE 802.11 WLANs are always half duplex because transmissions between stations use the same frequency or channel.</p>
<p>Basic Service Set</p>
<p>before a device can participate, it must advertise its capabilities and then be granted permission to join. The 802.11 standard calls this a basic service set (BSS). At the heart of every BSS is a wireless access point (AP),</p>
<p>The AP operates in infrastructure mode, which means it offers the services that are necessary to form the infrastructure of a wireless network. The AP also establishes its BSS over a single wireless channel. The AP and the members of the BSS must all use the same channel to communicate properly.</p>
<p>the operation of a BSS hinges on the AP, the BSS is bounded by the area where the AP’s signal is usable. This is known as the basic service area (BSA) or cell.</p>
<p>the cell is shown as a simple shaded circular area that centers around the AP itself.</p>
<p>It advertises the existence of the BSS so that devices can find it and try to join. To do that, the AP uses a unique BSS identifier (BSSID) that is based on the AP’s own radio MAC address.</p>
<p>Wireless devices must also have unique MAC addresses to send wireless frames at Layer 2 over the air.</p>
<p>the AP advertises the wireless network with a Service Set Identifier (SSID), which is a text string containing a logical name. Think of the BSSID as a machine-readable name tag that uniquely identifies the BSS ambassador (the AP), and the SSID as a nonunique, human-readable name tag that identifies the wireless service.</p>
<p>Membership with the BSS is called an association. A wireless device must send an association request to the AP and the AP must either grant or deny the request. Once associated, a device becomes a client, or an 802.11 station (STA), of the BSS.</p>
<p>As long as a wireless client remains associated with a BSS, most communications to and from the client must pass through the AP,</p>
<p>By using the BSSID as a source or destination address, data frames can be relayed to or from the AP.</p>
<p>SSID.
• &lsquo;MyNetwork&quot;
BSSID: &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>By sending data through the AP first, the BSS remains stable and under control.</p>
<p>Distribution System</p>
<p>The 802.11 standard refers to the upstream wired Ethernet as the distribution system (DS) for the wireless BSS,</p>
<p>the AP is in charge of mapping a virtual local-area network (VLAN) to an SSID.</p>
<p>SSID. &quot;
• MyNetwork&quot;

BSSID:</p>
<p>The AP must be connected to the switch by a trunk link that carries the VLANs.</p>
<p>The AP uses the 802.1Q tag to map the VLAN numbers to the appropriate SSIDs.</p>

F igure 26-7 Supporting Multiple SSIDs on One AP &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>The AP then appears as multiple logical APs—one per BSS—with a unique BSSID for each. With Cisco APs, this is usually accomplished by incrementing the last digit of the radio’s MAC address for each SSID.</p>
<p>Even though wireless clients can be distributed across many SSIDs, all of those clients must share the same AP’s hardware and must contend for airtime on the same channel.</p>
<p>Extended Service Set</p>
<p>When APs are placed at different geographic locations, they can all be interconnected by a switched infrastructure. The 802.11 standard calls this an extended service set (ESS),</p>
<p>Ideally, any SSIDs that are defined on one AP should be defined on all the APs in an ESS</p>

<p>Passing from one AP to another is called roaming</p>
<p>Each AP offers its own BSS on its own channel, to prevent interference between the APs. As a client device roams from one AP to another, it must scan the available channels to find a new AP (and BSS) to roam toward.</p>
<p>Independent Basic Service Set</p>
<p>The 802.11 standard allows two or more wireless clients to communicate directly with each other, with no other means of network connectivity. This is known as an ad hoc wireless network, or an independent basic service set (IBSS),</p>
<p>One of the devices must take the lead and begin advertising a network name and the necessary radio parameters, much like an AP would do.</p>
<p>Other Wireless Topologies</p>
<p>Repeater</p>
<p>A wireless repeater takes the signal it receives and repeats or retransmits it in a new cell area around the repeater.</p>
<p>Client A
Repeater
Client B &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>Some repeaters can use two transmitters and receivers to keep the original and repeated signals isolated on different channels. One transmitter and receiver pair is dedicated to signals in the AP’s cell, while the other pair is dedicated to signals in the repeater’s own cell.</p>
<p>Workgroup Bridge</p>
<p>WGB acts as an external wireless network adapter for a device that has none.</p>
<p>Client A

<p>You might encounter two types of workgroup bridges:</p>
<p>Universal workgroup bridge (uWGB): A single wired device can be bridged to a wireless network.</p>
<p>Workgroup bridge (WGB): A Cisco-proprietary implementation that allows multiple wired devices to be bridged to a wireless network.</p>
<p>Outdoor Bridge</p>
<p>act as a bridge to form a single wireless link from one LAN to another over a long distance.</p>
<p>One AP configured in bridge mode is needed on each end of the wireless link. Special purpose antennas are normally used with the bridges to focus their signals in one direction</p>

<p>A point-to-multipoint bridged link allows a central site to be bridged to several other sites</p>

V NVI &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>Mesh Network</p>
<p>In a mesh topology, wireless traffic is bridged from AP to AP, in a daisy-chain fashion, using another wireless channel.</p>
<p>Mesh APs can leverage dual radios—one using a channel in one range of frequencies and one a different range. Each mesh AP usually maintains a BSS on one channel, with which wireless clients can associate. Client traffic is then usually bridged from AP to AP over other channels as a backhaul network.</p>
<p>The mesh network runs its own dynamic routing protocol to work out the best path for backhaul traffic to take across the mesh APs.</p>
<p>RF Overview</p>
<p>Electromagnetic waves do not travel in a straight line. Instead, they travel by expanding in all directions away from the antenna.</p>
<p>frequency of the wave, or the number of times the signal makes one complete up and down cycle in 1 second</p>
<p>1 Second
Frequency = 4 cycles/second
= 4 Hertz</p>
<p>A hertz (Hz) is the most commonly used frequency unit and is nothing other than one cycle per second.</p>

1000 Hz &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>3 kHz to 300 GHz is commonly called radio frequency (RF).</p>
<p>Wireless Bands and Channels</p>
<p>Because a range of frequencies might be used for the same purpose, it is customary to refer to the range as a band of frequencies.</p>
<p>the range from 530 kHz to around 1710 kHz is used by AM radio stations; therefore, it is commonly called the AM band or the AM broadcast band.</p>
<p>One of the two main frequency ranges used for wireless LAN communication lies between 2.400 and 2.4835 GHz. This is usually called the 2.4-GHz band, even though it does not encompass the entire range between 2.4 and 2.5 GHz</p>
<p>The other wireless LAN range is usually called the 5-GHz band because it lies between 5.150 and 5.825 GHz. The 5-GHz band actually contains the following four separate and distinct bands:</p>
<p>5.150 to 5.250 GHz</p>
<p>5.250 to 5.350 GHz</p>
<p>5.470 to 5.725 GHz</p>
<p>5.725 to 5.825 GHz</p>
<p>Gap between 5.350 and 5.470</p>
<p>this gap exists and cannot be used for wireless LANs.</p>
<p>Do not worry about memorizing the band names or exact frequency ranges; just be aware of the two main bands at 2.4 and 5 GHz.</p>
<p>A frequency band contains a continuous range of frequencies.</p>
<p>bands are usually divided into a number of distinct channels. Each channel is known by a channel number and is assigned to a specific frequency.</p>

come available &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>Wireless client devices and APs can be compatible with one or more amendments;</p>
<p>APs can usually operate on both bands simultaneously to support any clients that might be present on each band.</p>
<p>wireless clients typically associate with an AP on one band at a time, while scanning for potential APs on both bands. The band used to connect to an AP is chosen according to the operating system, wireless adapter driver, and other internal configuration.</p>
<p>Cisco APs have dual radios (sets of transmitters and receivers) to support BSSs on one 2.4-GHz channel and other BSSs on one 5-GHz channel simultaneously. Some models also have two 5-GHz radios that can be configured to operate BSSs on two different channels at the same time, providing wireless coverage to higher densities of users that are located in the same vicinity.</p>
<p>RF signals propagate or reach further on the 2.4-GHz band than on the 5-GHz band. They also tend to penetrate indoor walls and objects easier at 2.4 GHz than 5 GHz. However, the 2.4-GHz band is commonly more crowded with wireless devices. Remember that only three nonoverlapping channels are available, so the chances of other neighboring APs using the same channels is greater. In contrast, the 5-GHz band has many more channels available to use, making channels less crowded and experiencing less interference.</p>

<h1 id="wireless-security">Wireless Security</h1>

<p>This chapter covers the following exam topics:</p>
<p>1.0 Network Fundamentals</p>
<p>1.11 Describe wireless principles</p>
<p>1.11.d Encryption</p>
<p>5.0 Security Fundamentals</p>
<p>5.9 Describe wireless security protocols (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3)</p>
<p>A comprehensive approach to wireless security focuses on the following areas:</p>
<p>Identifying the endpoints of a wireless connection</p>
<p>Identifying the end user (authentication)</p>
<p>Protecting the wireless data from eavesdroppers (encryption)</p>
<p>Protecting the wireless data from tampering (integrity)</p>
<p>Authentication</p>
<p>To use a wireless network, clients must first discover a basic service set (BSS) and then request permission to associate with it. Clients should be authenticated by some means before they can become functioning members of the wireless LAN.</p>
<p>A fake AP could also send spoofed management frames to disassociate or deauthenticate legitimate and active clients, just to disrupt normal network operation.</p>
<p>To prevent this type of man-in-the-middle attack, the client should authenticate the AP before the client itself is authenticated</p>
<p>Message Privacy</p>
<p>data should be encrypted for its journey through free space. This is accomplished by encrypting the data payload in each wireless frame just prior to being transmitted, then decrypting it as it is received. The idea is to use an encryption method that the transmitter and receiver share, so the data can be encrypted and decrypted successfully.</p>
<p>the AP should securely negotiate a unique encryption key to use for each associated client.</p>
<p>No other device should know about or be able to use the same keys to eavesdrop and decrypt the data.</p>
<p>The AP also maintains a “group key” that it uses when it needs to send encrypted data to all clients in its cell at one time. Each of the associated clients uses the same group key to decrypt the data.</p>
<p>Message Integrity</p>
<p>what if someone managed to alter the contents along the way? The recipient would have a very difficult time discovering that the original data had been modified.</p>
<p>A message integrity check (MIC) is a security tool that can protect against data tampering.</p>
<p>a way for the sender to add a secret stamp inside the encrypted data frame. The stamp is based on the contents of the data bits to be transmitted. Once the recipient decrypts the frame, it can compare the secret stamp to its own idea of what the stamp should be, based on the data bits that were received. If the two stamps are identical, the recipient can safely assume that the data has not been tampered with.</p>

<p>Wireless Client Authentication Methods</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Authentication</li>
</ol>
<p>original 802.11 standard offered only two choices to authenticate a client: open authentication and WEP.</p>
<p>Open authentication is true to its name; it offers open access to a WLAN. The only requirement is that a client must use an 802.11 authentication request before it attempts to associate with an AP. No other credentials are needed.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-a-fedora-distrobox-in-ublue">Setting up a fedora distrobox in ublue</h2>
<p>To create a Fedora 38 Distrobox, run:</p>
<p><code>distrobox create --image registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora-toolbox:38 --name fedora</code></p>
<p>Enter the box:
<code>distrobox enter fedora</code></p>
<p>To create an Ubuntu 22.04 Distrobox, run:</p>
<p><code>distrobox create --image docker.io/library/ubuntu:22.04 --name ubuntu</code></p>
<p>To create an Arch Linux Distrobox, run:</p>
<p><code>distrobox create --image docker.io/library/archlinux:latest --name arch</code></p>
<p>To create an Debian Linux Distrobox, run:</p>
<p><code>distrobox create --image docker.io/library/debian:latest --name debian</code></p>
<p><a href="https://distrobox.privatedns.org/compatibility/#containers-distros" rel="external" target="_blank">List of tested container images</a>.</p>
<p>When choosing an image for your container, consider which package manager and repos you want to use (e.g. <code>apt</code> vs. <code>pacman</code>), and pick one that you’re most comfortable with!</p>
<h2 id="exporting-programs-from-distrobox">Exporting programs from Distrobox</h2>
<p>You can export a GUI program (for example, <code>mpv</code>) by running the following from <strong>inside the Distrobox</strong>:</p>
<p><code>distrobox-export --app mpv</code></p>
<p>You can also export a binary or CLI program (for example, <code>vim</code>) by running the following from <strong>inside the Distrobox</strong>. You need to provide an export path and know where the original binary exists in the Distrobox’s filesystem. An easy way to find out is running <code>which vim</code> (replace <code>vim</code> with the name of the binary you want to export). The export command will create a shell script that runs the specified binary from inside the Distrobox.</p>
<p><code>distrobox-export --bin /usr/bin/vim --export-path ~/.local/bin</code></p>
<p><a href="https://distrobox.privatedns.org/usage/distrobox-export/" rel="external" target="_blank">Read more in the Distrobox documentation about <code>distrobox-export</code></a></p>
<h2 id="integrating-vscode-with-distrobox">Integrating VSCode with Distrobox</h2>
<p>There are two ways to integrate VSCode with a Distrobox.<br>
The easiest way is to just install it inside your Distrobox and <code>distrobox-export</code> it. The integrated terminal and all addons will then be run inside that single Distrobox. The other way is with <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers" rel="external" target="_blank">the Dev Containers extension</a>.<br>
Both ways are detailed inside <a href="https://distrobox.privatedns.org/posts/integrate_vscode_distrobox/" rel="external" target="_blank">the official Distrobox tutorial for integrating with VSCode</a></p>
<h2 id="using-the-hostsxdg-openinside-distrobox">Using the host’s <code>xdg-open</code> inside Distrobox</h2>
<p>Some GUI programs use <code>xdg-open</code> to open URLs, but it doesn’t work when running your browser on the host.<br>
You can fix this by adding the following shell script to your <code>~/.local/bin/</code> and giving it executable permissions.</p>
<p><code>#!/bin/bash if [ ! -e /run/.containerenv ] &amp;&amp; [ ! -e /.dockerenv ]; then # if not inside a container     /usr/bin/xdg-open &quot;$@&quot; # run xdg-open normally else     distrobox-host-exec /usr/bin/xdg-open &quot;$@&quot; # run xdg-open on the host fi</code></p>
<p>If you have <code>xdg-open</code> installed inside the Distrobox, you need to make sure that <code>~/.local/bin/</code> is in your <code>$PATH</code> before <code>/usr/bin/</code>.</p>

<h1 id="nextcloud-guide">Nextcloud Guide</h1>

<p>This is a step-by-step guide to setting up Nextcloud on a Debian server. You will need a server hosted by a VPS like Vultr. And a Domain hosted by a DNS provider such as Cloudflare</p>
<h3 id="what-is-nextcloud">What is Nextcloud?</h3>
<p>Nextcloud is so many things. It offers so many features and options, it deserves a bulleted list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free and open source</li>
<li>Cloud storage and syncing</li>
<li>Email client</li>
<li>Custom browser dashboard with widgets</li>
<li>Office suite</li>
<li>RSS newsfeed</li>
<li>Project organization (deck)</li>
<li>Notebook</li>
<li>Calender</li>
<li>Task manager</li>
<li>Connect to decentralized social media (like Mastodon)</li>
<li>Replacement for all of google&rsquo;s services</li>
<li>Create web forms or surveys</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also free and open source. This mean the source code is available to all. And hosting yourself means you can guarantee that your data isn&rsquo;t being shared.</p>
<p>As you can see. Nextcloud is feature packed and offers an all in one solution for many needs. The set up is fairly simple!</p>

<p>You will need to have a domain name set up for your server. I use Cloudflare to manage my DNS records. You will want to make a CNAME record for your nextcloud subdomain.</p>
<p>Just add &ldquo;nextcloud&rdquo; as the name and &ldquo;yourwebsite.com&rdquo; as the content. This will make it so &ldquo;nextcloud.yourwebsite.com&rdquo;. Make sure to select &ldquo;DNS Only&rdquo; under proxy status.</p>

<h3 id="you-are-ready-to-log-in-to-nextcloud">You are ready to log in to Nextcloud!</h3>
<p>Go to your nextcloud domain in a browser. In my case, I head to nextcloud.perfectdarkmode.com. Fill out the form to create your first Nextcloud user:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose an admin username and secure password.</li>
<li>Leave Data folder as the default value.</li>
<li>For Database user, enter the user you set for the SQL database.</li>
<li>For Database password, enter the password you chose for the new user in MariaDB.</li>
<li>For Database name, enter: nextcloud</li>
<li>Leave &ldquo;localhost&rdquo; as &ldquo;localhost&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Click Finish.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you are signed in. Here are a few things you can do to start you off:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the desktop and mobile app and sync all of your data. (covered below)</li>
<li>Look at different apps to consolodate your programs all in one place.</li>
<li>Put the Nextcloud dashboard as your default browser homepage and customize themes.</li>
<li>Set up email integration.</li>
</ul>

<li>Run the nextcloud desktop app and sign in.</li>
<li>Choose folders to sync.</li>
<li>Folder will be ~/Nextcloud.</li>
<li>Move everything into your nextcloud folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>This may break things with filepaths so beware. Now you are ready to use and explore nextcloud. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0APTeBFfSU" rel="external" target="_blank">video</a> from TechHut to get you started down the NextCloud rabbit hole.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository</li>
<li>Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder</li>
<li>When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified</li>
<li>You select the modified files you want to Stage</li>
<li>The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files</li>
<li>Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.</li>
<li>You can revert back to any previous commit.</li>
<li>Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="files-in-your-git-repository-folder-can-be-in-one-of-2-states">Files in your Git repository folder can be in one of 2 states:</h2>
<p>Tracked - files that Git knows about and are added to the repository
Untracked - files that are in your working directory, but not added to the repository
When you first add files to an empty repository, they are all untracked. To get Git to track them, you need to stage them, or add them to the staging environment.</p>
<h2 id="git-staging-environment">Git Staging Environment</h2>
<p>Staged files are files that are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on.</p>
<h2 id="git-commit">Git Commit</h2>
<p>Adding commits keep track of changes. Each commit is a  change point or &ldquo;save point&rdquo;.
You can (and should) include a message with each commit.</p>
<p><code>$ git commit</code></p>
<p><code>$ git commit -m &quot;add comment here&quot;</code>
* commit and add a comment
* -m flag adds a message</p>
<p><code>$ git commit -a -m &quot;add message here&quot;</code>
* -a flag automatically stage every changed, already tracked file</p>
<h2 id="commit-without-stage">Commit without stage</h2>
<ul>
<li>-a option will automatically stage every changed, already tracked file.</li>
<li>Can make you commit unwanted changes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="git-branch">Git Branch</h2>
<ul>
<li>Branch = A new/separate version of the main repository.</li>
<li>allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch.</li>
<li>a branch can be merged with the main project.</li>
<li>switch between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other.</li>
<li>Low storage/overhead</li>
</ul>
<p><code>$ git branch branch-name-here</code>
* create branch with name</p>
<h2 id="checkout">Checkout</h2>
<ul>
<li>Need to check out a branch before committing or the branch will not be included.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>$ git checkout newImage; git commit</code></p>
<p>create a new branch AND check it out at the same time
<code>$ git checkout -b [yourbranchname]</code></p>
<h2 id="what-is-github">What is GitHub?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Git is not the same as GitHub.</li>
<li>GitHub makes tools that use Git.</li>
<li>GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="git-merge">Git Merge</h2>
<ul>
<li>Combine work from two different branches.</li>
<li>Creates a special commit with two parents</li>
</ul>
<p><code>$ git merge branch-name</code>
- makes a new commit with two parent (Main and the chosen branch)
- Doesn&rsquo;t merge the branch unless you check out the branch first.</p>
<p><code>$ git checkout branch-name; git merge main</code>
- checkout branch and merge with main</p>
<h2 id="git-rebase">Git Rebase</h2>
<ul>
<li>Another way of combining work between branches</li>
<li>Takes a set of commits and copies them to somewhere else</li>
<li>can be used to make a nice linear sequence of commits.</li>
<li>commit log / history of the repository will be a lot cleaner if only rebasing is allowed.</li>
<li>moves th</li>
</ul>
<p><code>$ git rebase main</code>
- adds selected branch as a commit over main
<code>$ git rebase branch-name</code>
- You will also need to checkout main and rebase it to the last commit</p>
<h2 id="head">HEAD</h2>
<ul>
<li>the symbolic name for the currently checked out commit</li>
<li>always points to the most recent commit
Detaching head</li>
<li>attaching head to a commit instead of a branch</li>
</ul>
<p><code>$ git checkout commit-name</code>
- checks out the commit and attaches the head</p>

<h1 id="building-a-minimalist-website-with-hugo">Building a Minimalist Website with Hugo</h1>

<p>Word Press is great, but it is probably a lot more bloated then you need for a personal website. Enter Hugo, it has less server capacity and storage needs than Word Press. Hugo is a static site generator than takes markdown files and converts them to html.</p>
<p>Hosting your own website is also a lot cheaper than having a provider like Bluehost do it for you. Instead of $15 per month, I am currently paying $10 per year.</p>
<p>This guide will walk through building a website step-by-step.</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting up a Virtual Private Server (VPS)</li>
<li>Registering a domain name</li>
<li>Pointing the domain to your server</li>
<li>Setting up hugo on your local PC</li>
<li>Syncing your Hugo generate site with your server</li>
<li>Using nginx to serve your site</li>
<li>Enable http over SSL</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="setting-up-a-virtual-private-server-vps">Setting up a Virtual Private Server (VPS)</h2>
<p>I use Vultr as my VPS. When I signed up they had a $250 credit towards a new account. If you select the cheapest server (you shouldn&rsquo;t need anything else for a basic site) that comes out to about $6 a month. Of course the $250 credit goes towards that which equates to around 41 months free.</p>
<p>Head to vultr.com. Create and account and  Select the Cloud Compute option.</p>
<p>Under CPU &amp; Storage Technology, select &ldquo;Regular Performance&rdquo;. Then under &ldquo;Server Location, select the server closest to you. Or closest to where you think your main audience will be.</p>
<p>Under Server image, select the OS you are most comfortable with. This guide uses Debian.</p>
<p>Under Server Size, slect the 10GB SSD. Do not select the &ldquo;IPv6 ONLY&rdquo; option. Leave the other options as default and enter your server hostname.</p>
<p>On the products page, click your new server. You can find your server credentials and IPv4 address here. You will need these to log in to your server.</p>
<p>Log into your sever via ssh to test. From a Linux terminal run:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>ssh username@serveripaddress</code></pre></div><p>Then, enter your password when prompted.</p>
<h2 id="registering-a-domain-name">Registering a Domain Name</h2>
<p>I got my domain perfectdarkmode.com from Cloudflare.com for about $10 per year. You can check to see available domains there. You can also check <a href="https://www.namecheckr.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">https://www.namecheckr.com/</a> to see iof that name is available on various social media sites.</p>
<p>In CloudFlare, just click &ldquo;add a site&rdquo; and pick a domain that works for you. Next, you will need your server address from earlier.</p>
<p>Under domain Registration, click &ldquo;Manage Domains&rdquo;, click &ldquo;manage&rdquo; on your domain. One the sidebar to the right, there is a qucik actions menu. Click &ldquo;update DNS configuration&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Click &ldquo;Add record&rdquo;. Type is an &ldquo;A&rdquo; record. Enter the name and the ip address that you used earlier for your server. Uncheck &ldquo;Proxy Status&rdquo; and save.</p>
<p>You can check to see if your DNS has updated on various DNS severs at <a href="https://dnschecker.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">https://dnschecker.org/</a>. Once those are up to date (after a couple minutes) you should be able to ping your new domain.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>[davidthomas@fedora posts]$ ping perfectdarkmode.com

<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>ssh username@domain.com</code></pre></div><h2 id="setting-up-hugo-on-your-local-pc">Setting up hugo on your local PC</h2>
<p>Hugo is a popular open-source static site generator. It allows you to take markdown files, and builds them into and html website. To start go to <a href="https://gohugo.io/installation/" rel="external" target="_blank">https://gohugo.io/installation/</a> and download Hugo on your local computer. (I will show you how to upload the site to your server later.)</p>
<p>Pick a theme
The theme I use is here <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/" rel="external" target="_blank">https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/</a></p>
<p>You can browse your own themes as well. Just make sure to follow the installation instructions. Let&rsquo;s create a new Hugo site. Change into the directory where you want your site to be located in. Mine rests in ~/Documents/.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>cd ~/Documents/</code></pre></div><p>Create your new Hugo site.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>hugo new site site-name</code></pre></div><p>This will make a new folder with your site name in the ~/Documents directory. This folder will have a few directories and a config file in it.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>archetypes  config.toml  content  data  layouts  public  resources  static  themes</code></pre></div><p>For this tutorial, we will be working with the config.toml file and the  content, public, static, and themes. Next, load the theme into your site directory. For the Hello Friend NG theme:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>git clone https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git themes/hello-friend-ng</code></pre></div><p>Now we will load the example site into our working site. Say yes to overwrite.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>cp -a themes/hello-friend-ng/exampleSite/* .</code></pre></div><p>The top of your new config.toml site now contains:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>baseURL = &#34;https://example.com&#34;
title   = &#34;Hello Friend NG&#34;
languageCode = &#34;en-us&#34;
theme = &#34;hello-friend-ng&#34;</code></pre></div><p>Replace your baseURL with your site name and give your site a title. Set the enableGlobalLanguageMenu option to false if you want to remove the language swithcer option at the top. I also set enableThemeToggle to true so users could set the theme to dark or light.</p>
<p>You can also fill in the links to your social handles. Comment out any lines you don&rsquo;t want with a &ldquo;#&rdquo; like so:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>[params.social](params.social)
    name = &#34;twitter&#34;
    url  = &#34;https://twitter.com/&#34;

  [params.social](params.social)
    name = &#34;email&#34;
    url  = &#34;mailto:nobody@example.com&#34;

  [params.social](params.social)
    name = &#34;github&#34;
    url  = &#34;https://github.com/&#34;

  [params.social](params.social)
    name = &#34;linkedin&#34;
    url  = &#34;https://www.linkedin.com/&#34;

 # [params.social](params.social)
   # name = &#34;stackoverflow&#34;
   # url  = &#34;https://www.stackoverflow.com/&#34;</code></pre></div><p>You may also want to edit the footer text to your liking. I commented out the second line that comes with the example site:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>[params.footer]
    trademark = true
    rss = true
    copyright = true
    author = true

    topText = []
    bottomText = [
     # &#34;Powered by &lt;a href=\&#34;http://gohugo.io\&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;&#34;,
     #  &#34;Made with &amp;#10084; by &lt;a href=\&#34;https://github.com/rhazdon\&#34;&gt;Djordje Atlialp&lt;/a&gt;&#34;
    ]</code></pre></div><p>Now, move the contents of the example contents folder over to your site&rsquo;s contents folder (giggidy):</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>cp -r ~/Documents/hugo/themes/hello-friend-ng/exampleSite/content/* ~/Documents/hugo/content/</code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s clean up a little bit. Cd into ~/Documents/hugo/content/posts. Rename the file to the name of your first post. Also, delete all of the other files here:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>cd ~/Documents/hugo/contents/posts
mv goisforlovers.md newpostnamehere.md
find . ! -name &#39;newpostnamehere.md&#39; -type f -exec rm -f {} +</code></pre></div><p>Open the new post file and delete everything after this:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>+++

  name = &#34;David Thomas&#34;
+++</code></pre></div><p>You will need to fill out this header information for each new post you make. This will allow you to give your site a title, tags, date, categories, etc. This is what is called a TOML header. TOML stands for Tom&rsquo;s Obvious Minimal Language. Which is a minimal language used for parsing data. Hugo uses TOML to fill out your site.</p>
<p>Save your doc and exit. Next, there should be an about.md page now in your ~/Documents/hugo/Contents folder. Edit this to edit your about page for your site. You can use this Markdown Guide if you need help learning markdown language. <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">https://www.markdownguide.org/</a></p>
<p>Note: To insert an image into your post. Add the image to your ~/Documents/hugo/static directory. Then reference the image in your post like this:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code></code></pre></div><h3 id="serve-your-website-locally">Serve your website locally</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s test the website by serving it locally and accessing it at localhost:1313 in your web browser. Enter the command:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>hugo serve</code></pre></div><p>Hugo will now be generating your website. You can view it by entering localhost:1313 in your webbrowser.</p>
<p><a href="#R-image-d0c4ab457606ee845f9351096dc31b35" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="hugo1" class="noborder lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/hugo1.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>

<p>You can use this to test new changes before uploading them to your server. When you svae a post or page file such as your about page, hugo will automatically update the changes to this local page if the local server is running.</p>
<p>Press &ldquo;Ctrl + c&rdquo; to stop this local server. This is only for testing and does not need to be running to make your site work.</p>
<h3 id="build-out-your-public-directory">Build out your public directory</h3>
<p>Okay, your website is working locally, how do we get it to your server to host it online? We are almost there. First, we will use the hugo command to build opur website in the public folder. Then, we will make a copy of our public folder on our server using rsync. I will also show you how to create an alias so you do not have to remember the rsync command every time.</p>
<p>From your hugo site folder run:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>[davidthomas@fedora hugo]$ hugo
Start building sites … 
hugo v0.98.0+extended linux/amd64 BuildDate=unknown

  Sitemaps         |  1  
  Cleaned          |  0  

Total in 65 ms</code></pre></div><p>Next, we will put your public hugo folder into /var/www/ on your server. Here is how to do that with an alias. Open ~/.bashrc.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>vim ~/.bashrc</code></pre></div><p>Add the following line to the end of the file, making sure to replace the username and server name:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code># My custom aliases
alias rsyncp=&#39;rsync -rtvzP ~/Documents/hugo/public/ username@myserver.com:/var/www/public&#39;</code></pre></div><p>Save and exit the file. Then tell bash to update it&rsquo;s source config file.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>source ~/.bashrc</code></pre></div><p>Now your can run the command by just using the new alias any time. Your will need to do this every time you update your site locally.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>rsyncp</code></pre></div><h2 id="set-up-nginx-on-your-server">Set up nginx on your server</h2>
<p>Install nginx</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>apt update

<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/public</code></pre></div><p>You will need to add the following to the file, update the options, then save and exit:</p>

<p>Link this site-available config file to sites-enabled to enable it. Then restart nginx:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/public /etc/nginx/sites-enabled

<p>We will need to make sure nginx has permissions to your site folder so that it can access them to serve your site. Run:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>chmod 777 /var/www/public</code></pre></div><h3 id="firewall-permissions">Firewall Permissions</h3>
<p>You will need to make sure your firewall allows port 80 and 443. Vultr installs the ufw program by default. But your can install it if you used a different provider. Beware, enabling a firewalll could block you from accessing your vm, so do your research before tinkering outside of these instructions.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>ufw allow 80
ufw allow 443</code></pre></div><h3 id="nginx-security">Nginx Security</h3>
<p>We will want to hide your nginx version number on error pages. This will make your site a bit harder for hackers to find exploits. Open your Nginx config file at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and remove the &ldquo;#&rdquo; before &ldquo;server_tokens off;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enter your domain into your browser. Congrats! You now have a running website!</p>
<h2 id="use-certbot-to-enable-https">Use Certbot to enable HTTPS</h2>
<p>Right now, our site uses the unencrypted http. We want it to use the encrypted version HTTPS (HTTP over SSL). This will increase user privacy, hide usernames and passwords used on your site, and you get the lock symbol by your URL name instead of &ldquo;!not secure&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="install-certbot-and-its-nginx-module">Install Certbot and It&rsquo;s Nginx Module</h3>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>apt install python3-certbot-nginx</code></pre></div><h3 id="run-certbot">Run certbot</h3>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>certbot --nginx</code></pre></div><p>Fill out the information, certbot asks for your emaill so it can send you a reminder when the certs need to be renewed every 3 months. You do not need to consent to giving your email to the EFF. Press 1 to select your domain. And 2 too redirect all connections to HTTPS.</p>
<p>Certbot will build out some information in your site&rsquo;s config file. Refresh your site. You should see your new fancy lock icon.</p>

<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>crontab -e</code></pre></div><p>Select a text editor and add this line to the end of the file. Then save and exit the file:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>0 0 1 * * certbot --nginx renew</code></pre></div><p>You now have a running website. Just make new posts locally, the run &ldquo;hugo&rdquo; to rebuild the site. And use the rsync alias to update the folder on your server. I will soon be making tutorials on making an email address for your domain, such as <a href="mailto:david@perfectdarkmode.com" rel="external" target="_blank">david@perfectdarkmode.com</a> on my site. I will also be adding a comments section, RSS feed, email subscription, sidebar, and more.</p>

<p>I couldn’t find a guide on how to set up Calibre web step-by-step as a Docker container. Especially not one that used Nginx as a reverse proxy.</p>
<p>The good news is that it is really fast and simple. You’ll need a few tools to get this done:</p>
<ul>
<li>A server with a public IP address</li>
<li>A DNS Provider (I use CloudFlare)</li>
<li>Docker</li>
<li>Nginx</li>
<li>A Calibre Library</li>
<li>Certbot</li>
<li>Rsync</li>
</ul>
<p>First, sync your local Calibre library to a folder on your server:</p>
<p>rsync -avuP your-library-dir <a href="mailto:root@example.org" rel="external" target="_blank">root@example.org</a>:/opt/calibre/</p>
<h1 id="install-docker">Install Docker</h1>
<p>sudo apt update<br>
sudo apt install docker.io</p>
<p>Create a Docker network</p>
<p>sudo docker network create calibre_network</p>
<p>Create a Docker volume to store Calibre Web data</p>
<p>sudo docker volume create calibre_data</p>
<p>Pull the Calibre Web Docker image</p>
<p>sudo docker pull linuxserver/calibre-web</p>
<p>Start the Calibre Web Docker container</p>
<p>sudo docker run -d \<br>
&ndash;name=calibre-web \<br>
&ndash;restart=unless-stopped \<br>
-p 8083:8083 \<br>
-e PUID=$(id -u) \<br>
-e PGID=$(id -g) \<br>
-v calibre_data:/config \<br>
-v /opt/calibre/Calibre:/books \<br>
&ndash;network calibre_network \<br>
linuxserver/calibre-web</p>
<h1 id="configure-nginx-to-act-as-a-reverse-proxy-for-calibre-web">Configure Nginx to act as a reverse proxy for Calibre Web</h1>
<p>Create the site file</p>
<p>sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/calibre-web</p>
<p>Add the following to the file</p>
<p>server { listen 80;<br>
server_name example.com; # Replace with your domain or server IP location /<br>
{<br>
proxy_pass http://localhost:8083;<br>
proxy_set_header Host $host;<br>
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;<br>
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;<br>
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;<br>
} }</p>
<p>Enable the site</p>
<p>sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/calibre-web /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/</p>
<p>Restart Nginx</p>
<p>sudo service nginx restart</p>
<h1 id="dns-cname-record">DNS CNAME Record</h1>
<p>Make sure to set up a cname record for your site with your DNS provider such as: calibre.example.com</p>
<h1 id="ssl-certificate">SSL Certificate</h1>
<p>Install ssl cert using certbot</p>
<p>certbot &ndash;nginx</p>
<h1 id="site-setup">Site Setup</h1>
<p>Head to the site at <a href="https://calibre.example.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">https://calibre.example.com</a> and log in with default credentials:</p>
<p>username: admin<br>
password: admin123</p>
<p>Select /books as the library directory. Go into admin settings and change your password.</p>
<h1 id="adding-new-books">Adding new books</h1>
<p>Whenever you add new books to your server via the rsync command from earlier, you will need to restart the Calibre Web Docker container. Then restart Nginx.</p>
<p>sudo docker restart calibre-web<br>
systemctl restart nginx</p>
<p>That’s all there is to it. Feel free to reach out if you have issues.</p>

<h1 id="setting-up-an-e-mail-inbox">Setting up an E-mail Inbox</h1>
<p>In the article on <a href="https://landchad.net/mail/smtp" rel="external" target="_blank">SMTP and Postfix</a>, we set up a simple Postfix server that we could use to programatically send mail with the <code>mail</code> command. In order to have a true and fully-functional mail server, users should be able to login to a mail client where they can read their inbox and send mail remotely. In order to achieve this we need Dovecot, which can store mails received by the server, authenticate user accounts and interact with mail.</p>
<p>If we’re setting up an inbox we will also want spam detection software, such as spam assassin.</p>
<h2 id="dovecot-and-spamassassin">Dovecot and Spamassassin</h2>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>apt install dovecot-imapd dovecot-sieve spamassassin spamc</code></pre></div><p>Unblock the imap port:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>ufw allow 993</code></pre></div><h2 id="certificate">Certificate</h2>
<p>We will want a SSL certificate for the <code>mail.</code> subdomain. We can get this with <a href="https://landchad.net/basic/certbot/" rel="external" target="_blank">Certbot</a>. Assuming we are using Nginx for our server otherwise, run:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>certbot --nginx certonly -d mail.example.org</code></pre></div><h2 id="dns">DNS</h2>
<p>We also need two little DNS records set on your domain registrar’s site/DNS server:</p>
<ol>
<li>An MX record. Just put your domain, <strong>example.org</strong>, in the “Points to” field.</li>
<li>A CNAME record. Host field: <strong>mail.example.org</strong>. “Points to” field: <strong>example.org.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="configuring-dovecot">Configuring Dovecot</h2>
<p>Dovecot&rsquo;s configuration file is in <code>/etc/dovecot/docevot.conf</code>. If you open that file, you will see this line: <code>!include conf.d/*.conf</code> which adds all the <code>.conf</code> files in <code>/etc/dovecot/conf.d/</code> to the Dovecot configuration.</p>
<p>One can edit each of these files individually to get the needed configuration, but to make things easy here, delete or backup the main configuration file and we will replace it with one single config file with all important settings in it. Make sure you change <code>ssl_cert</code> and <code>ssl_key</code> accordingly.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-wide" data-lang="wide"># Note that in the dovecot conf, you can use:

}</code></pre></div><h3 id="settings-explained">Settings Explained</h3>
<p>Take a good look at the above settings to understand what&rsquo;s going on. Some of the settings include:</p>
<ol>
<li>SSL settings to allow encrypted connections.</li>
<li>The mail server will authenticate users against PAM/passwd, which means users you create on the server (so long as they are part of the <code>mail</code> group) will be able to receive and send mail.</li>
<li>Default directories for a mail account: Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Junk, Trash and Archive.</li>
<li>Create a <code>unix_listener</code> that will allow Postfix to authenticate users via Dovecot.</li>
<li>Setup the Dovecot sieve plugin, which provides mail filtering facilities at time of final message delivery. Sieve scripts can be used to customize how messages are delivered, whether they’re forwarded or stored in special folders.</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, we can tell sieve to automatically move mail flagged as spam to the junk folder:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>echo &#34;require [\&#34;fileinto\&#34;, \&#34;mailbox\&#34;];
if header :contains \&#34;X-Spam-Flag\&#34; \&#34;YES\&#34;
        {
                fileinto \&#34;Junk\&#34;;
        }&#34; &gt; /var/lib/dovecot/sieve/default.sieve</code></pre></div><p>After that, we should create the <code>vmail</code> user and group, which will access the mails, and then update the sieve configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>grep -q &#39;^vmail:&#39; /etc/passwd || useradd vmail
chown -R vmail:vmail /var/lib/dovecot
sievec /var/lib/dovecot/sieve/default.sieve</code></pre></div><p>Then, enable pam authentication for Dovecot:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>echo &#34;auth    required        pam_unix.so nullok
account required        pam_unix.so&#34; &gt;&gt; /etc/pam.d/dovecot</code></pre></div><h2 id="connecting-postfix-and-dovecot">Connecting Postfix and Dovecot</h2>
<p>We need to tell Postfix to look to Dovecot for authenticating users/passwords. Dovecot will be putting an authentication socket in <code>/var/spool/postfix/private/auth</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>postconf -e &#39;smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes&#39;

postconf -e &#39;mailbox_command = /usr/lib/dovecot/deliver&#39;</code></pre></div><h2 id="connecting-postfix-and-spamassassin">Connecting Postfix and Spamassassin</h2>
<p>We will change <code>/etc/postifx/master.cf</code> so postfix can route mail through spamassassin. First we can cleanup the default configuration. Feel free to make a backup.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>sed -i &#39;/^\s*-o/d;/^\s*submission/d;/^\s*smtp/d&#39; /etc/postfix/master.cf</code></pre></div><p>Finally, run this command to finish the configuration for spamassassin.</p>

<h1 id="writing">Writing</h1>

<p>Writing is the single most important skill you can have in business and in life. We do it every day. Everyone is a writer. You write when you are sending emails. You Write when you are commenting code. You write when you make a grocery list.</p>
<p>AI is taking over and writing tons of low quality crap on the interwebs. Now is the best time to up your writing game and stand out over the robots. Hone your craft and AI will never be able to compete.</p>
<p>Reach out to me if you need any help. I LOVE writing blog posts about tech, personal development, and more.</p>

<h1 id="writing-off-the-cuff">Writing Off the Cuff</h1>

<p>My favorite and by far easiest method of writing is writing off the cuff. You get your thoughts down and spring new thoughts to life. You are finding out what you know without referencing materials.</p>
<p>You are creating out of nothing. It is pure writing and creativity folded into one. We all have a “Muse” that will give to us whenever we ask.</p>
<p>All you have to do is start writing.</p>
<h1 id="writers-block-doesnt-exist">Writer’s block doesn’t exist.</h1>
<p>Writer’s Block sucks. You don’t Know what to write next. You are stuck in limbo. But are you really stuck? You really can’t Think of ANYTHING to put down next?</p>
<p>Writer’s Block is a trick! Perhaps it’s An excuse cropping up to get you out of the zone.</p>
<p>Your thoughts never stop. So start there. What’s The first thing that comes to mind when you read your last sentence?</p>
<p>Just write that down and move on. Follow your train of thought to find out who you really are.</p>
<p>And to find out what you really have to say.</p>
<h1 id="the-first-draft-is-always-garbage">The first draft is always garbage.</h1>
<p>Live it. Accept it. Once you do. It doesn’t matter what you write. Just put down whatever comes to your mind. No matter how bad it seems. You will touch up later.</p>
<p>Writers block doesn’t even exist. It’s Just a concept. You aren’t writing because you can’t think of anything.</p>
<p>It’s because you are a perfectionist. You are unwilling to put down “garbage” on a piece of paper.</p>
<h1 id="just-keep-going">Just keep going…</h1>
<p>Don’t Stop. You have set aside this time to create. And creating is what gets your blood flowing. It’s The reason you are alive.</p>
<p>Distractions are going to try and stop you. They are the enemy. And this is how you win.</p>
<p>Stay on the course. The wind is your muse and your sail is your unrelenting determination.</p>
<p>The ocean wants to keep your from going anywhere. It can’t do this if you do not will it.</p>
<h1 id="the-conclusion-doesnt-matter">The conclusion doesn’t matter.</h1>
<p>You have to end your writing. But this is not the end. It is actually a new beginning for your reader. You have given them your best.</p>
<p>Remind them what you said and give them a plan of what is next. You just changed a life forever. No matter how big or small of a change.</p>
<p>This is your impact. This is why you are here.</p>

<h1 id="the-3-jobs-for-you-as-a-parent">The 3 jobs for you as a parent</h1>
<ol>
<li>Control obnoxious Behavior (STOP behaviors)</li>
<li>Encourage good behavior (START behaviors)</li>
<li>Strengthening your relationship with your children</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="controlling-obnoxious-behavior-stop-behaviors">Controlling obnoxious behavior (STOP Behaviors)</h1>
<p>This is where counting and break times come in. You will use counting and break times for STOP behaviors.</p>
<h2 id="taking-breaks-and-counting">Taking Breaks and Counting</h2>
<p>A break is when parents and child can separate briefly so they can calm down and regroup. You do not talk about the behavior after the break. No need to punish the child twice. If the behavior was dangerous, unusual, or new, then give a brief explanation.</p>
<p>3 counts are needed before a break occurs. And after you&rsquo;ve tried ignoring, sympathetic listening, distraction, and joint problem solving.</p>
<p>You and your child may fall for the arguing/ yelling/ hitting/ persuading/ defending/ rationalizing trap. You need to start counting before this happens. Once you notice that you&rsquo;ve fallen in this trap. Simply go back to counting.</p>
<p>The parents tone should not be anger/ negative. It should simply be &ldquo;I love you but you simply cannot behave this way&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="straight-to-3">Straight to 3!</h2>
<p>Major behavior goes straight to 3 and taking a break. This is stuff like hitting, spitting, etc. Still, you must be gentle and consistent. Then the child&rsquo;s behavior will mature over time.</p>
<p>Your child won&rsquo;t behave rationally when they are upset. Same goes to you! The brain is just not wired that way. When dealing with a child, you must manage the yelling/ screaming/ whining/ fighting. All while encouraging positive behaviors like eating, doing homework, cleaning up, going to bed and child/parent bonding.</p>
<p>To be an effective parent you must be gentle and friendly. The message your child receives should be that you love them and will take care of them.</p>
<p>You must also balance this with being firm and letting them know that you expect them to do something.</p>
<p>Children also will model your behavior. Like if you solve problems with anger. They will to. If you are calm and collected. They will learn that from you as well.</p>
<h2 id="counting-is-for-stop-behaviors">Counting is for STOP behaviors</h2>
<p>You must control negative behaviors. These are things you want your children to STOP doing. And what you will use COUNTING for.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Physical attacks on people , breaking something, fighting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teasing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whining</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Temper (intimidation, &ldquo;I HATE YOU!&rdquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arguing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Badgering (wearing you down with repetition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tantrums</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yelling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Threat (I&rsquo;m running away from home)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Martyrdom (&ldquo;I never get anything&rdquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crying, pouting, looking sad on purpose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saying something is unfair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Butter up &ldquo;you are the nicest dad in the world!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promises/ insincere apologies</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is controlling obnoxious behavior. Or the demanding side of parenting. This teaches you and your child to hold back and avoid dysfunctional responses.</p>
<p>Methods for stop behaviors</p>
<h3 id="counting">Counting</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go straight to 3 if behavior is dangerous or extreme</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t talk or get angry, just count</li>
<li>Voice should be casual but stern</li>

<li>Keep quit and ignore for minor offenses (depending on your fuse)</li>
<li>When in doubt count</li>
<li>Take about 5 seconds between counts</li>
<li>Start the counting cycle over longer as the child gets older. (15 minutes for 5 year old, 2-3 hours for an 11 year old, etc.</li>
<li>Do not punish bad grades, use the reward system for grades instead.</li>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need to punish dog to make behavior not rewarding</p>
<p>Instead, figure out how to make the right behavior rewarding enough</p>
<p>Reward behaviors you want</p>
<p>Ignore or prevent behaviors that you don&rsquo;t want</p>
<h2 id="your-dog-already-knows-everything-you-are-going-to-teach-him">Your dog already knows everything you are going to teach him</h2>
<h2 id="teach-him-the-english-words-for-those-behaviors-and-make-them-very-rewarding-and-fun">Teach him the english words for those behaviors and make them very rewarding and fun</h2>

<p>reward consistenly and generously for behaviors that you do want</p>
<h1 id="training-cues">Training Cues</h1>
<p>Oops</p>

<p>Can phase out use of food as reward when behavior is solid enough</p>
<p>A dog is NEVER 100% reliable</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t ignore your dog when they are doing good</p>
<h2 id="asking-for-an-incompatible-behavior">Asking for an incompatible Behavior</h2>

<h2 id="lets-walk">Let&rsquo;s Walk</h2>
<p>When you tolerate pulling, your dog learns that pulling gets them where they want to go</p>

<p>Three Elements to stay:</p>
<p>Duration – How long dog stays</p>
<p>Distraction - Realiability</p>
<p>Distance – Distance you can move away from dog</p>
<p>Work on duration and distraction first</p>
<p>Do not ask for too much too soon</p>
<p>Ask them to sit for one second, click and treat and be calm so they don&rsquo;t jump up</p>
<p>Use release word to encourage dog to get up</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t click the release cause you are training the stay behavior</p>

<p>Step to side click release, jump on one foot click release!</p>
<p>Taking it gradually is the key here.</p>
<p>Then add distance</p>
<p>Teach them that stay is never over until you return to them</p>
<p>At higher levels you can call from stay 1 out of 10 times</p>

<h1 id="the-poisoned-cue">The poisoned Cue</h1>
<p>Habituation occurs when your dog learns to ignore an environmental stimulus—a sound,</p>
<p>Sometimes sensitization occurs instead. Rather than habituating to a sound such as the doorbell, a dog may become more and more reactive each time the stimulus occurs. Thunder sensitivity is a perfect example of this.</p>
<p>Learned irrelevance is similar to habituation. It applies to a dog who has learned to ignore a specific cue, rather than become accustomed to a startling stimulus. This is not deliberate willfulness on the dog’s part, but rather her lack of response to a cue that has failed to have consistent and sufficiently strong significance attached to it. The cue becomes meaningless if it doesn’t have a consequence.</p>
<p>“poisoned cue.” A cue becomes poisoned when it sometimes has a negative consequence instead of a positive one.</p>
<p>it will be easier for you to train her to come with a new cue than to try to make the association consistently positive.</p>
<p>I have heard owners and trainers use words such as close, let’s go, and here in place of a poisoned Come.</p>
<p>Once you’ve trained a new Come cue, you have to remember not to poison that one too. If you have to do something to your dog that she’s not fond of, do something wonderful when she gets to you, and a few minutes later end the fun and do the not-so-nice thing.</p>
<p>Or go get her instead of calling her to you. Meanwhile, make it a point to change her association with the things she doesn’t like. Teach her that a hand moving toward her collar makes yummy treats happen.</p>
<p>Teach her that a hand moving toward her paw makes yummy treats happen. Then touching her paw. Then holding her paw. Then touching her paw with nail clippers. This process of counterconditioning and desensitization—changing the association with a stimulus—can be applied in countless training and behavior modification situations.</p>
<p>It works best when done gradually with numerous repetitions at each step, and not moving on until the dog is obviously happy about the process at each step.</p>
<p>The fewer things a dog must do in her world (or have done to her) that she doesn’t like, the less likely you are to poison her Come cue!</p>
<h2 id="salience">SALIENCE</h2>
<p>When we say something is salient to a dog, we mean it has noticeable significance to her. Your dog learns to sit even in the face of distractions because the hotdog you are holding in front of her face is very salient.</p>
<p>significant. The salient stimuli in the environment—you, your hotdogs, and the Sit cue—are more significant than the distractions. They overshadow the dog barking across the street, the skateboarder whizzing by on the road, the slamming of a car door down the block. If your dog is too distracted to respond to the Sit cue, then the distractions are more salient than you and your hotdogs.</p>
<p>You either need to move your training to a less distracting environment, or find a way to make you, your treats, and your cues more significant to your dog.</p>
<h2 id="blocking">BLOCKING</h2>
<p>when the use of a known cue overrides the dog’s ability to learn a new cue for the same behavior. Keep in mind that while dogs can only learn one response to a particular cue (sit must always mean “sit,” it can’t sometimes mean lie down), they can learn several cues that all mean the same behavior.</p>
<p>(treat), I introduce the verbal cue and explain that any new cue being taught must always precede the known cue.</p>
<p>I use a demo dog to show them that the dog doesn’t initially understand or respond to the word down until we associate it with the luring motion that means “down” to the dog.</p>
<p>The motion is salient to the dog—the word is not. I explain to my students that in order for the dog to hear the word and learn that it also has significance, they must say the word first, then lure the dog down.</p>
<p>If they give the verbal cue at the same time or after they lure, the lure blocks the dog’s ability to learn the new cue. With enough repetitions of the sequence—verbal cue, followed by lure (and click! and treat when the dog performs the behavior)—the dog will learn that the verbal cue also has salience, and you will no longer need to lure her down—she will lie down when you give her the verbal cue.</p>
<h2 id="fading-the-lure">FADING THE LURE</h2>
<p>One of the biggest complaints you’ll hear about positive training is that you always have to have food in your hand to get your dog to do what you ask. This is true only if you don’t make the effort to fade your lures—that is, to get your dog to respond to your cues when there’s no treat in sight. If you don’t fade lures fairly early in your training program, you and your dog can both become dependent on the presence of food to get behaviors to happen. The good news is it’s easy to fade lures; you just have to remember to follow the steps to do it. Let’s take Down as our example:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Lure the behavior: Move your treat toward the floor, clicking your dog for following, giving a nibble of treat with each click!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the cue: When she lures down easily every time, say the Down cue each time just before you lure her down. Repeat a half-dozen times. Remember to click! and treat each time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pause before luring: Now say “Down!” and pause. Wait for several seconds, then lure her down. Click! Treat. By following the word with the lure, you are translating, telling her that the word down means exactly the same thing as moving the treat toward the floor. Repeat several times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a little body language: As you say “Down!” or immediately thereafter, bend forward just a tiny bit from the waist. Since you probably bend forward when you lure, this little body language hint might jump-start your dog’s brain into moving down. If not, wait a few seconds and then lure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch for clues: Sometimes your dog will make small movements that tell you she’s starting to make the connection between the cue and the behavior. When you give the Down cue, she may look at the floor or lower her shoulders a little bit and then look at you as if to say, “Is this right? Is this what you mean?” If you catch these clues with a click! and quickly lure her the rest of the way, you’ve answered her question and she’ll probably understand and respond to the cue more quickly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="extinction">EXTINCTION</h2>
<p> Extinction means taking a behavior that has been reinforced and making it go away by removing all reinforcement.</p>
<p>You can deliberately extinguish an unwelcome behavior by taking away any reinforcement your dog might be getting for it. We extinguish the behavior of jumping up by making sure no one pets, talks to, or looks at the dog when she jumps, and by stepping away so she doesn’t even have the pleasure of making contact with her paws.</p>
<p>You can also accidentally extinguish a desired behavior by forgetting to reinforce it or by not reinforcing it enough. Reinforcement isn’t always treats—it’s anything your dog likes: toys, play, eye contact, praise, pets, runs . . .</p>
<p>When you use extinction to make a behavior go away, be aware that there is often an extinction burst—the behavior gets worse before it gets better because the dog is trying really hard to get reinforcement for a behavior that paid off in the past.</p>
<p>You want to be sure not to reinforce the dog during an extinction burst, or you’ve just taught her that trying harder gets reinforced. Don’t give in (unless the dog is in danger of injuring herself); comfort yourself with the knowledge that the extinction burst usually means you’re close to success.</p>
<p>spontaneous recovery. Days, weeks, or even months after you extinguished a behavior, it suddenly rears its ugly head again,</p>
<p>of circumstances occurred to refire the same old neuron pathway. The good news is, assuming you make sure the behavior isn’t reinforced, it should go away again quickly, and much more easily than the first time.</p>
<h2 id="premack">Premack</h2>
<p>you can use a more rewarding behavior as the reinforcer for a less rewarding behavior, thereby improving the performance of the lesser behavior.</p>
<p>For example, if your dog would rather chase a bunny than come when you call her, you can use the Premack principle to teach her that she will get to chase a bunny—sometimes—if she comes to you first.</p>
<p>You start by using Premack indoors in a controlled environment to teach her how it works, and when she’s doing well there, move her outside. Leave your dog on a sit/stay and walk across the room. Your helper, with a plate of tasty treats, stands halfway between you and your dog, slightly off to one side. Your helper should also have a bowl to cover the treats when your dog tries to eat them. Now call your dog. If she stops to investigate the plate of treats, the helper covers the plate and doesn’t let her have a taste.</p>
<p> You keep calling your dog cheerfully and enthusiastically. When she finally comes to you, gently grasp her collar, say “Good girl!” then release her collar and say “Go get it!” Race with your dog back to the treats, now uncovered, and let her have a couple of bites.</p>
<p>Then cover the plate and try it again. Eventually—sometimes surprisingly quickly—she will realize that she gets the treats sooner if she comes to you first and she will fly past the uncovered plate as fast as she can. This principle is also sometimes called Grandma’s Law, expressed as “You have to eat your vegetables before you can eat your dessert.”</p>
<p>There are a couple of drawbacks to using Premack in real life: (1) If the vegetables are too unpalatable, dessert may also lose its appeal; and (2) you can’t control the bunnies.</p>
<h2 id="generalization">Generalization</h2>
<p>how do you help your dog learn to generalize operant behaviors? By doing exactly what your trainer probably told you to do—practice with her in as many different places as possible.</p>
<h2 id="chaining-and-backchaining">CHAINING AND BACKCHAINING</h2>
<p>The behaviors are linked together so that each behavior is the signal for the next behavior in the chain, and the opportunity to perform the next behavior becomes the reinforcer for the previous one.</p>
<p>Backchaining begins with the last behavior in the chain. Each step is added in reverse order, until the dog is performing the complete behavior. The theory is that when you teach the last thing first, your dog is always moving toward what she knows best, so she gains confidence as she learns the new links in the chain. The theory works.</p>
<h2 id="the-principle-of-parsimony">THE PRINCIPLE OF PARSIMONY</h2>
<p>unless there is evidence to the contrary, you must account for a phenomenon with the simplest explanation available.</p>
<h1 id="house-training">House Training</h1>
<p>think in terms of what you want him to do.</p>
<p>housetraining, an ounce of prevention is worth many pounds of cure.</p>
<p>will start using the phrase Do It when he starts to eliminate. This will teach him to go to the bathroom on cue</p>
<h1 id="social-misfits">Social Misfits</h1>
<p>As they get older (8 to 16 weeks), they are given careful exposure to other stimuli—visits to the vet hospital and groomer; walks in town; rides on elevators and escalators; sounds of cars, motorcycles, and skateboards; people of different ages, sexes, and ethnic backgrounds; people who dress, talk, and move in strange ways; and people with umbrellas, crutches, wheelchairs, and facial hair. The more positive exposures a dog has to a wide variety of experiences during this period, the more confident and well adjusted she will be throughout her life, and the more easily she will accept new experiences, even without prior exposure.</p>
<p>the steps to take to foster courage in an unsocialized canine:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Teach your dog a reward marker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reward-mark his entire meal. If the dog is extremely unsocialized—fearful even of you—let this be the only way she gets to eat: by being in your company and, eventually when she’s brave enough, by eating out of your hand. She needs to learn that you are the source of all good things. Reward-marking won’t work well for a free-roaming feral dog—she will have access to other food sources and won’t have to tolerate your presence to find food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reward-mark her for calm behavior around others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a list of her fear triggers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use counterconditioning and desensitization. Desensitization is the process of gradually acclimating the dog to the things she is afraid of. Counterconditioning means replacing her involuntary undesirable reaction—fear—with a more desirable one that is incompatible with fear, such as the eager anticipation of a tasty treat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reward-mark while others feed treats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teach her to target.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Caution: Avoid Coddling!</p>
<h1 id="be-happy">Be Happy</h1>
<p>Healthy dogs chew. They also bark, dig, and run around. These behaviors are natural and necessary for them.</p>
<p>teach him to go to the bathroom at appropriate appropriate times, in appropriate places. You will be far more successful in dealing with the challenges of chewing, digging, and barking if you address these natural behaviors the same way.</p>
<h1 id="choose-your-chews">CHOOSE YOUR CHEWS</h1>
<p>Stuffed Kong toys, marrow bones, and other indestructible but inviting chew objects are better choices than items that resemble our valued human possessions. Discarded socks and old tennis shoes teach a pup to head for the closet floor and the laundry basket when the chewing urge is strong.</p>
<p>Carrots, apples, and other hard raw fruits and vegetables are also ideal puppy chews—</p>
<p>Goodie Ship stuffed with liver treats.</p>
<p>Chewing is also a good stress reliever, which is why dogs who are anxious about being left alone at home often become destructive.</p>
<p>puppies should gradually be conditioned to being left alone so they can overcome their very strong and natural instinct to always be in the company of their pack. Providing your dog with a desirable and appropriate chew object prior to your calm departure can often help prevent separation anxiety from becoming a problem.</p>
<h1 id="safety-first">Safety First</h1>
<p>Dogs have been known to choke on rawhide, which can get soft and slimy when chewed,</p>
<p>Rope toys can shred, and if swallowed, the pieces of string can become entangled in a dog’s intestines—a life-threatening situation. Plastic eyes, noses, and squeakers from plush toys also pose a hazard to your dog’s well-being.</p>
<p>the black rubber Kong toys are among the toughest</p>
<h1 id="oldies-but-goodies">Oldies but Goodies</h1>
<p>you can regularly give your dog chicken and turkey wings and necks. Note: These are fed raw, not cooked, as part of a complete diet plan.</p>
<p>The Whole Dog Journal is a good resource for information on feeding a natural, healthy diet, as are books by Dr. Ian Billinghurst.</p>
<p>Punishing Jaws after you take a forbidden object away from him does no good—he is likely to think that the last thing he did (giving up the object) is what he’s being punished for. Jaws can learn very quickly that chewing on an item of high value to humans is a good thing to do because it will initiate a rousing game of chase the puppy. If you punish him after you catch him, you won’t teach him not to play the game; you’ll just teach him to run faster next time! Don’t let him suck you into his game—use management and supervision to interrupt and redirect him before he is doing doughnuts around the dining room table with your $150 running shoe in his mouth.</p>
<h1 id="digging">Digging</h1>
<p>Dogs who are most likely to engage in inappropriate digging are those who are left to their own devices in the backyard for long periods.</p>
<p>my philosophy of dog-human relationships, they belong anyway. Dogs are companion animals, and they serve that function best when they share our homes (dens) with us. Dogs who are exiled to a pen or to the backyard are often excruciatingly bored and/or lonely, which gives rise to a long list of behavior problems, including barking, digging, escaping, hyperactivity, poor socialization, and aggression.</p>
<p>If you want, you can even encourage your dog to dig—in the right place. Just as you teach your dog when and where it’s okay to go to the bathroom, you can teach Dozer when and where it’s okay for him to dig. You can build a wooden digging box frame—spacious enough to accommodate Dozer’s size with room to spare—and set it where you want him to dig. Dig up the dirt within the framed area so it is soft and inviting. If your dirt is hard clay, add sand and potting soil to break up the soil and keep it soft. Now invite Dozer to dig in his box by burying a toy or bone just beneath the surface of the soil. Get excited and tell Dozer to go dig. Then help him dig up the toy. Repeat this game often, until he will run to his box and start digging from anywhere in the yard when you tell him to go dig. You can bury toys and bones in the box when he’s not looking so that he never knows what he’ll find in there. If you do see him starting to dig where he shouldn’t, say “Oops! Go dig!” to interrupt and invite him back to the box. If he doesn’t have lots of unsupervised time to reward himself for digging in the wrong places, he will eventually confine his digging to his box. An additional benefit to teaching him the Go Dig cue is that you can use it anytime you are in a place where digging is allowed—like the beach, where digging in the sand is great fun for dogs and humans alike. You can also make use of his talents when you need a hole dug—to plant a tree, put in fence posts, or perhaps bury a treasure.</p>
<h1 id="barking">Barking</h1>
<p>Simply slapping a no-bark electric shock collar (shudder) around the backyard dog’s neck may stop the barking, but it does nothing to help the dog become less bored, lonely, or frustrated. My answer to the dog owner who asks how to get a dog to stop barking in the backyard day and night is simply to bring him indoors. This relieves his loneliness because: • He is now more a part of the family • It does away with boredom because there are more interesting things going on inside the house</p>
<p>• It shuts out the stimuli that frustrate him—like squirrels in the trees and cats on the fence • It lifts the burden from his shoulders of feeling like he’s the only member of the pack who is guarding the den</p>
<p>we just want to be able to turn the barking off when we want. You can do this with a positive interrupt, or you can get more inventive and teach Woofie to bark on cue in order to teach him to stop barking on cue.</p>
<p>To use the positive interrupt, begin by teaching Woofie that over here means “Turn toward me for a click! and a treat.” Practice this on-leash with a small distraction, like sniffing a bush, until Woofie looks to you eagerly when he hears the Over Here cue.</p>
<p>“Over Here!” As soon as he stops barking and turns toward you for his treat, click! and tell him “Quiet. Good boy!” then click! again for the quiet and give him another treat. (I actually have my clients say “Thank you!” to their dogs when we do this, to remind them that we really do appreciate having our dogs alert us to unusual visitors and events.)</p>
<p>whatever it is that gets Woofie to bark—walking up the sidewalk, knocking on the door, opening the door, or whatever. The more you repeat it, the less excited</p>
<p>Woofie will be about the knock on the door and the quicker he will be to turn toward you on the Over Here cue. Of course, the next time someone comes to the door, Woofie will be excited all over again—it takes time and numerous repetitions of this exercise to get Woofie to give up his deeply ingrained, out-of-control barking behavior. Remember that you are not using the Quiet cue to make your dog stop barking—you are waiting until he stops barking and then telling him that the behavior of not barking is called quiet. In time, when Woofie has learned to associate the word with the behavior of being quiet, you will be able to get him to stop barking with the Quiet cue, but if you use it in the beginning while he’s barking, you will be teaching him that quiet actually means “bark.” In fact, I honestly believe that a lot of dogs think their owners are barking with them when they are actually yelling at them to shut up! I avoid teaching dogs to bark on cue if they don’t already bark a lot, but for those who are problem barkers, it can be a superb solution to the barking behavior challenge. Getting the bark on cue is the easy part—barky dogs are usually more than willing to offer the behavior. You probably already know what stimulates Woofie to bark. If it’s a knock on the door, then knock on the door, click! when he barks, and feed him a treat. If this works, do it again, but say “Speak!” or “Who’s there?” just before you knock. When he barks, click! and treat. Because he likes to bark anyway, in very short order he will probably bark for you on just the verbal cue, without the knock. Aside from using this exercise to teach Woofie to be quiet on cue, it can also be useful for self-protection. I had one client who taught her dog that What Do You Want? was the cue to start barking. She could then use it if she felt threatened by an approaching stranger, and her very friendly dog would bark nonstop and quite convincingly keep the potential bad guy at a distance. Now that you have the bark on cue, you can teach Quiet or Enough by clicking and rewarding a pause in the barking. Again, remember that in the beginning you won’t be asking Woofie to stop barking with the verbal cue; you’ll just be associating the quiet word with the cessation of barking. Eventually, when you know he has made the connection between the word and the behavior, you will be able to use the cue to ask him to stop barking. Remember first to thank him for alerting you to something going on in the world. You never know when he might be trying to tell you that there’s a burglar outside, that Timmy has fallen into the well, or that your horses are running down your driveway.</p>
<h1 id="separation-anxiety">Separation Anxiety</h1>
<p>Separation anxiety (SA), the canine equivalent of a panic disorder,</p>
<p>A less intense stress response in dogs over being left alone is called isolation distress (ID).</p>
<p>Spend fifteen to twenty minutes in a hard play session every morning to take the edge off Shep’s energy level before you leave the house.</p>
<p>• Provide as much exercise as possible at other times of the day as well. A dog who has a reservoir of pent-up energy is more stressed than one who is tired. A tired dog is usually a happier and better-behaved dog.</p>
<p>• Be calm when you leave and return. Dramatic good-byes and hellos raise Shep’s anxiety level.</p>
<p>• Give Shep a Kong toy or marrow bone filled with peanut butter or cheese just before you leave.</p>
<p>• Do not crate Shep unless you know she stays calm in the crate while you are gone.</p>
<h1 id="biting">Biting</h1>
<p>all dogs can bite. And under the right set of circumstances, the gentlest, most loving dog can be induced to bite.</p>
<p>high. Aggression is caused by stress. Each thing (stimulus) that causes a dog stress is a small building block (stressor) toward that dog’s bite threshold.</p>
<p>a dozen or more commonly recognized classifications of aggression, including status-related aggression, fear-related aggression, maternal aggression (a mom protecting her puppies), play aggression (when a dog’s level of arousal escalates during play and turns into aggression), displaced aggression, pain aggression, territorial aggression, possession aggression, protection aggression, barrier aggression, and redirected aggression.</p>
<h1 id="resource-guarding">Resource Guarding</h1>
<p>You can build on this foundation by working with Gimme at her mealtimes in a four-week resource-guarding program. Begin by setting her dish on the counter and putting her kibble in it. During week one, feed her the entire meal by hand, one kibble at a time. Have other family members take turns feeding her, and even allow an occasional visitor to do it so that she really gets the concept that humans deliver resources. Be sure to include children in the mix—you want her to realize that having small humans around her food bowl is a good thing. In week two, set Gimme’s empty food bowl on the floor and put her meal in a second dish on the counter. Now drop a few kibbles into her dish, and while she is eating those, drop a few more. You want her to realize that when a human hand approaches her bowl it is not coming to take her food away; instead, more food is coming. Again, have all the family participate, and include an occasional friend in the mealtime ritual. During week three, put her bowl on the floor with about ¼ of her meal already in it. As she eats, continue to add more kibble, and occasionally add something really wonderful, like a slice of hot dog, chicken, or roast beef. Now you are teaching her that not only does the approaching hand bring more food, it actually brings better food. By now she should be pretty well convinced that having humans around her food bowl is a wonderful idea. In the final week of your food bowl training, continue to drop kibble into her bowl as she eats. Now, assuming that she is showing absolutely no signs of food guarding when you reach toward her bowl, pick the bowl up while at the same time you drop pieces of her really wonderful treat on the floor. The message you’re giving to Gimme is that food bowl going away = really wonderful food on the ground. While you have the food bowl in your hand, put a few more pieces of the really wonderful treat in it and set it back down on the ground after she has finished the treats you dropped. You are simply reinforcing the concept that having humans mess with her food bowl is good—it returns to her with even better stuff in it. If you, and others, for the rest of Gimme’s life, continue to occasionally drop great stuff in her bowl while she is eating, she will always recognize humans near her bowl as a good thing and should never develop a food-guarding problem.</p>
<p>Dogs do what feels good, or, as behaviorists say, behavior is reward driven. If your dog is doing something that you want to change, at some level it is rewarding to her. Find out what the reward is and you are well on your way to changing the behavior.</p>
<p>Your attention is a huge reinforcer. Even negative attention (like yelling) is reinforcing—in your dog’s mind, something is better than nothing.</p>
<h1 id="babies-and-kids">Babies and Kids</h1>
<p>make good things happen whenever babies were around.</p>
<p>Don’t be stingy here—leave Lady’s dinner kibble at home. Instead, get out the hot dogs, cheese, steak, chicken—whatever Lady likes best—and keep feeding her one tiny piece at a time. You don’t even need to click! her for this; you’re not trying to change or teach a behavior; you’re trying to influence the way that her brain responds to the presence of children. (This is called classical conditioning, like Pavlov’s salivating dogs.) We just want Lady to realize that the presence of babies and small children is a reliable predictor of wonderful treats.</p>
<p>You can also have the babies’ parents or babysitters and some well-behaved small children feed treats to Lady and pet her gently so that she realizes that not only do good things happen when kids are around, some of the good things actually come from the children.</p>
<p>• Never leave dogs, babies, and/or small children (under age 10—or older if the dog is large and active) together unsupervised. No matter how trustworthy the dog, a responsible adult must always be actively observing the interaction between dog and baby human(s).</p>
<p>• Give the dog an escape route. When Junior starts moving, he can be pretty determined and irritating.</p>
<p>toddler fingers in her eyes, ears, and mouth. Teach Lady how to jump over a low barrier to reach safety if she has had enough baby for the moment. Dogs who can’t escape their tiny tormentors are more likely to bite in self-defense. • Teach your dog bite inhibition so that if she does feel compelled to bite in self-defense, she will give an inhibited warning bite rather than a serious bite. (See chapter 22, “A Biting Commentary.”) • Teach your children to respect the dog. Children should handle dogs gently and kindly. As soon as Junior is old enough to understand, he needs to learn that it is not okay to hit, poke, kick, or pull Lady’s ears or tail. He should also be taught that Lady’s crate is her sanctuary—she is never to be disturbed there. Until he is old enough to understand, it is the responsibility of the supervising adult to prevent Junior from tormenting Lady. • Teach your children basic dog safety tips: • Never approach an unfamiliar dog. • Never run away from a dog. • Never scream near a dog. • Stand still when an unfamiliar dog approaches. • Do not hug a dog unless an adult has told you that you can hug him.</p>
<p>• Do not stare into a dog’s eyes. • Do not disturb a dog who is sleeping, eating, resting in his crate, or with or near her puppies. • Do not play with a dog unless supervised by an adult.</p>

<li>
<p>Training your dog should be fun! A competent instructor will allow and encourage you to observe a class prior to making the decision to enroll. In a well-run class, dogs and people will be enjoying themselves and having a successful learning experience. Look for an instructor who is approachable and who encourages participants to have a good time. If space permits, an instructor should welcome and encourage all family members and others who interact with the dog to attend class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A skilled class instructor will Provide a clear explanation of each lesson. Demonstrate the behavior(s) that students will be teaching to their dogs. Provide clear instructions and written handouts on how to teach the behavior(s). Give students ample time in class to begin practicing the day’s lesson. Assist students individually with proper implementation of techniques. 3. A skilled and professional trainer will encourage dialogue and be courteous to both canine and human clients alike. 4. You want to be comfortable with the training tools and methods used by the instructor. A skilled and professional dog trainer employs humane training methods that are not harmful to the dog and/or handler and avoids the practices of hanging, beating, kicking, shocking, and all similar procedures or training devices that could cause the dog great pain or distress, or that have imminent potential for physical harm. You have the absolute right to stop any trainer or other animal-care professional who, in your opinion, is causing your dog undue harm or distress. 5. A conscientious trainer will stay informed about innovations in dog training and behavior tools and techniques. Check to see if the instructor is a member of any</p>

</ol>
<p>educational organizations such as the APDT, and whether s/he pursues ongoing educational opportunities. 6. A good instructor will take care to protect your dog’s health in a group setting. Ask if dogs and puppies are required to be vaccinated prior to class and, if so, which vaccines are required. Make sure you and your veterinarian are comfortable with the vaccination requirements. 7. Current clients are a valuable source of information for you. Attending a group class gives you the opportunity to ask clients how they feel about their experience—if they are enjoying the class and feel that their training needs and goals are being met. 8. Because of variables in dog breeding and temperament and owner commitment and experience, a trainer cannot and should not guarantee the results of his/her training. However, an instructor can and should be willing to ensure client satisfaction with his/her professional services.</p>

<p>Click (or a mouth click, finger snap, the words “Yes,” “Click,” or “Tick”): What you were doing at the exact moment you heard the click is earning you a food reward.</p>
<p>Come: Run quickly to me. (You might also want it to mean “and sit right in front of me.”)</p>
<p>Dog’s Name: Look at me and wait for further instructions.</p>
<p>Down: Lie down on the ground (not get off something or someone).</p>
<p>Excuse Me: Walk backward.</p>

<p>Let’s Walk: Walk with me without pulling on the leash, or walk closely with me with no leash, but not necessarily in the heel position.</p>
<p>No: What you are doing is very bad or dangerous—stop immediately! (Use very sparingly, just for life-threatening situations, and when you do use it, say it like you mean it!)</p>
<p>Oops (or Wrong, Mistake, Sorry): The behavior you are doing will not earn you a reward. (This is referred to as a no-reward marker and is also used sparingly.)</p>
<p>Relax: Lie flat on your side.</p>
<p>Sit (not Sit Down): Put yourself in the sitting position from whatever position you are in now.</p>
<p>Stand: Stand still on all four legs. Stay: Don’t move from the position I left you in until I release you.</p>
<p>Take It: Take food or an object into your mouth (the beginning of teaching a dog to retrieve).</p>
<p>Touch: Touch your nose to a designated target. Wait: Pause. Stop moving, either until I leave or until I release you. (This is less formal than stay.)</p>
