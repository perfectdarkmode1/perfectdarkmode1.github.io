      <description>For years, famous dog trainers like Cesar Milan would teach people to train dogs with aversive tactics and “Dominance”. It turns out these methods are just plain cruel and make things much worse for your dog.
So much so that even police forces have banned the use of aversive training to get highly trained killer attack dogs.
Dogs lack the contextual ability to understand what punishments are. They will usually just make your doggo scared of you.</description>
