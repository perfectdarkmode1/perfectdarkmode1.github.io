    <description>Hey, I’m David. I am a tech enthusiast interested in Linux, open source projects, Networking, scripting, programming, and cybersecurity. This is my hub where I will be teaching as I learn. This will help me pick up skills better and hopefully help others along the way.&#xA;The site name “Perfect Dark Mode” is a throwback to the game “Perfect Dark” and the best visual theme for any technology, dark mode.</description>
