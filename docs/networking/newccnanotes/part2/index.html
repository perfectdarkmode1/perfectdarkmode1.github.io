Topology Information and LSAs<br>
Each LSA is a data structure with some specific information about the network topology; the<br>
LSDB is simply the collection of all the LSAs known to a router.<br>
before sending an LSA to yet another neighbor, routers communicate, asking “Do you already have this LSA?,” and then sending the LSA to the next neighbor only if the neighbor has not yet<br>
learned about the LSA.<br>
Routers reflood an LSA when some information changes(for example, when a link goes up or<br>
comes down). They also minutes). reflood each LSA based on each LSA’s separate aging timer(default 30</p>

OSPF neighbors are routers that both use OSPF and both sit on the same data link.can become OSPF neighbors if connected to the same VLAN, or same serial link, or same Two routers<br>

they must send OSPF messages and agree to become OSPF neighbors.To do so, therouters send<br>
OSPF Hello messages, introducing themselves to the potential neighbor. Assuming the two potential neighbors have compatible OSPF parameters, the two form an OSPF neighbor<br>

allows new routers to be dynamically discovered. That means new routers can be added to a<br>
network without requiring every router to be reconfiguredHello messages from new routers and react to those messages, attempting to become neighbors. Instead, OSPF routers listen for OSPF<br>
and exchange LSDBs.<br>
Meeting Neighbors and Learning Their Router ID<br>
process starts with messages called OSPF Hello messages. The Hellos in turn list each router’s<br>
router ID (RID), which serves as each router’s unique name or identifier for OSPF. does several checks of the information in the Hello messages to ensure that the two routers Finally, OSPF<br>
should become neighbors.<br>
OSPF RIDs are 32 - bit numbers.</p>
<p>OSPF RIDs are 32 - bit numbers.<br>
By default, IOS chooses one of the router’s interface IPv4 addresses to use as its OSPF RID.However, the OSPF RID can be directly configured</p>

<p>Each router keeps an OSPF state variable for how it views the neighbor.</p>
<p>Hello. This message tells R1 that R2 exists, and it allows R1 to move through the init state and<br>
quickly to a 2-way state.<br>

First, they tell each other a list of LSAs in their respective databases—not all the details of the<br>
LSAs, just a list. (Think of these lists as checklists.) Then each router can check which LSAs it already has and then ask the other router for only the LSAs that are not known yet.<br>
the OSPF messages that actually send the LSAs between neighbors are called Link(LSU) packets.That is, the LSU packet holds data structures called link-state advertisements -State Update<br>
(LSA). The LSAs are not packets, but rather data structures that sit inside the LSDB and describe the topology.<br>
Maintaining Neighbors and the LSDB<br>
First, the Hello Interval and the Dead Interval. routers monitor each neighbor relationship using Hello messages and two related timers:Routers send Hellos every Hello Interval to each<br>
neighbor.so if a neighbor is silent for the length of the Each router expects to receive a Hello from each neighbor based on the Hello Interval, Dead Interval (by default, four times as long as the<br>
Hello Interval),the loss of Hellos means that the neighbor has failed.<br>

Each router’s LSDB now reflects the fact that the original router’s G0/0 interface failed, so each router will then use SPF to recalculate any routes affected by the failed interface.
A third maintenance task done by neighbors is to reflood each LSA occasionally, even when the network is completely stable. By default, each router that creates an LSA also has the
responsibility to reflood the LSA every 30 minutes (the default), even if no changes occurthateach LSA has a separate timer, based on when the LSA was created, so there is no single big. (Note

OSPF Passive Interfaces<br>
When no routers exist on a link<br>
OSPF continues to advertise about the subnet that is connected to the interface.<br>
OSPF no longer sends OSPF Hellos on the interface.<br>
OSPF no longer processes any received Hellos on the interface.<br>

relationships over the interface.<br>

OSPF Default Routes<br>
All routers learn specific (nondefault) routes for subnets inside the company; a default route is not needed when forwarding packets to these destinations.<br>
One router connects to the Internet, and it has a default route that points toward the Internet.<br>
All routers should dynamically learn a default route,that all packets destined to locations in the Internet go to the one router connected to the used for all traffic going to the Internet, so<br>

uses that address, the first host simply does not use the address until the problem is resolved.<br>
a host sends an NS message for its own IPv6 address. No other host should be using that address,<br>

<p>Basic Service Set<br>
before a device can participate, it must advertise its capabilities and then be granted permission to join. The 802.11 standard calls this a basic service set (BSS). At the heart of every BSS is a<br>
wireless access point (AP),<br>
The AP operates ininfrastructure mode,which meansit offers the services that are necessary to<br>

Wireless devices must also have unique MAC addresses to send wireless frames at Layer 2 over<br>
the air.<br>
the AP advertises the wireless network with a Service Set Identifier (SSID), which is a text string containing a logical name.Think of the BSSID as a machine-readable name tag that uniquely<br>

<p>By using the BSSID as a source or destination address, data frames can be relayed to or from the AP.</p>
<p>By sending data through the AP first, the BSS remains stable and under control.<br>

<p>Wireless Bands and Channels<br>
Because a range of frequencies might be used for the same purpose, it is customary to refer to the range as a band of frequencies.<br>
the range from 530 kHz to around 1710 kHz is used by AM radio stations; therefore, it is commonly called the AM band or the AM broadcast band.<br>
One of the two main frequency ranges used for wireless LAN communication lies between 2.400<br>
and 2.4835 GHz. This is usually called the 2.4entire range between 2.4 and 2.5 GHz -GHz band, even though it does not encompass the<br>
The other wireless LAN range is usually called the 55.825 GHz. The 5-GHz band actually contains the following four separate and distinct bands:-GHz band because it lies between 5.150 and<br>

Gap between 5.350 and 5.470 this gap exists and cannot be used for wireless LANs.<br>
Do not worry about memorizing the band names or exact frequency ranges; just be aware of the two main bands at 2.4 and 5 GHz.<br>
A frequency band contains a continuous range of frequencies.<br>
bands are usually divided into a number of distinct channels. Each channel is known by a channel<br>

Connecting a Cisco WLC<br>
Cisco wireless controllers differ a bit; ports and interfaces refer to different concepts.<br>
Controller ports are physical connections made to an external wired or switched network, whereas interfaces are logical connections made internally within the controller</p>
<p>Using WLC Ports<br>
You can connect several different types of controller ports to your network, as shown in Figure 29 - 5 and discussed in the following list:<br>
<strong>Service port:</strong> functions; always connects to a switch port in access modeUsed for out-of-band management, system recovery, and initial boot<br>
<strong>Distribution system port:</strong> to a switch port in 802.1Q trunk modeUsed for all normal AP and management traffic; usually connects<br>
<strong>Console port:</strong> functions; asynchronous connection to a terminal emulator (9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop Used for out-of-band management, system recovery, and initial boot<br>
bit, by default)<br>
<strong>Redundancy port:</strong> Used to connect to a peer controller for high availability (HA) operation<br>
Controllers can have a single service port that must be connected to a switched network. Usually, the service port is assigned to a management VLAN so that you can access the controller with SSH<br>
or a web browser to perform initial configuration or for maintenance. Notice that the service port supports only a single VLAN, so the corresponding switch port must be configured for access mode<br>
only.<br>
Controllers also have multiple distribution system ports that you must connect to the network. These ports carry most of the data coming to and going from the controller. For example, the<br>
CAPWAP tunnels (control and data) that extend to each of a controller’s APs pass across the distribution system ports. Client data also passes from wireless LANs to wired VLANs over the<br>
ports. In addition, any management traffic using a web browser, SSH, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), and so on, normally reaches<br>
the controller in-band through the ports.<br>
the distribution system ports always operate in 802.1Q trunking mode.<br>
The distribution system ports can operate independently, each one transporting multiple VLANs to a unique group of internal controller interfaces. For resiliency, you can configure<br>
distribution system ports in redundant pairs. One port is primarily used; if it fails, a backup</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>distribution system ports in redundant pairs. One port is primarily used; if it fails, a backup port is used instead.
Controller distribution system ports can be configured as a link aggregation group (LAG) such that they are bundled together to act as one larger link
traffic can be load-balanced across the individual ports that make up the LAG
LAG offers resiliency; if one individual port fails, traffic will be redirected to the remaining working ports instead.
Cisco WLCs do not support any link aggregation negotiation protocol, like LACP or PAgP, at all.</code></pre></div><p>Using WLC Interfaces<br>
the controller must somehow map those wired VLANs to equivalent logical wireless networks<br>
APs.VLAN must be connected to a unique wireless LAN that exists on a controller and its associated<br>
Cisco wireless controllers provide the necessary connectivity through internal logical interfaces, which must be configured with an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and a Dynamic Host<br>
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Each interface is then assigned to a physical port and a VLAN ID. You can think of an interface as a Layer 3 termination on a VLAN.<br>
Cisco controllers support the following interface types:<br>
<strong>Management interface:</strong> authentication, WLC-to-WLC communication, webUsed for normal management traffic, such as RADIUS user -based and SSH sessions, SNMP, Network<br>
Time Protocol (NTP), syslog, and so on. The management interface is also used to terminate CAPWAP tunnels between the controller and its APs.<br>
<strong>Redundancy management</strong> a high availability pair of controllers. The active WLC uses the management interface : The management IP address of a redundant WLC that is part of<br>
address, while the standby WLC uses the redundancy management address.<br>
<strong>Virtual interface:</strong> DHCP requests, performing client web authentication, and supporting client mobility.IP address facing wireless clients when the controller is relaying client<br>
<strong>Service port interface:</strong> Bound to the service port and used for out-of-band management.<br>
<strong>Dynamic interface:</strong> Used to connect a VLAN to a WLAN.</p>
<p>The management interface faces the switched network, where management users and APs are located. Management traffic will usually consist of protocols like HTTPS, SSH, SNMP, NTP, TFTP,<br>
and so on<br>
consists of CAPWAP packets that carry control and data tunnels to and from the APs.<br>
The virtual interface is used only for certain client-facing operations.<br>
when a wireless client issues a request to obtain an IP address, the controller can relay the request on to an actual DHCP server that can provide the appropriate IP address<br>
DHCP server appears to be the controller’s virtual interface address. Clients may see the virtual interface’s address, but that address is never used when the controller<br>
communicates with other devices on the switched network.<br>
Because the virtual interface is used only for some client management functions, you should configure it with a unique, nonroutable address. For example, you might use 10.1.1.1<br>
because it is within a private address space defined in RFC 1918.<br>
The virtual interface address is also used to support client mobility.<br>
every controller that exists in the same mobility group should be configured with a virtual address that is identical to the others. By using one common virtual address, all<br>
the controllers will appear to operate as a cluster as clients roam from controller to controller.<br>
Dynamic interfaces map WLANs to VLANs,<br>
making the logical connections between wireless and wired networks. You will configure one dynamic interface for each wireless LAN that is offered by the controller’s APs and then<br>
map the interface to the WLAN.<br>
Each dynamic interface must also be configured with its own IP address and can act as a DHCP relay for wireless clients. To filter traffic passing through a dynamic interface, you can<br>
configure an optional access list.<br>
Configuring a WLAN<br>
To complete the path between the SSID and the VLAN, as illustrated in Figure 29define a WLAN on the controller. -7, you must first</p>
<p>The controller will bind the WLAN to one of its interfaces and then push the WLAN configuration out to all of its APs by default.</p>
<p>Like VLANs, you can use WLANs to segregate wireless users and their traffic into logical networks. Users associated with one WLAN cannot cross over into another one unless their<br>
traffic is bridged or routed from one VLAN to another through the wired network infrastructure.</p>
<p>Cisco controllers support a maximum of 512 WLANs, but only 16 of them can be actively configured on an AP.<br>
Advertising each WLAN to potential wireless clients uses up valuable airtime.<br>
Every AP must broadcast beacon management frames at regular intervals to advertise the existence of a BSS</p>
<p>Beacons are normally sent 10 times per second, or once every 100 ms, at the lowest mandatory data rate<br>
if you create too many WLANs, a channel can be starved of any usable airtime<br>
always limit the number of WLANs to five or fewer; a maximum of three WLANs is best<br>
Before you create a new WLAN, think about the following parameters it will need to have:<br>
SSID string<br>
Controller interface and VLAN number<br>
Type of wireless security needed<br>
you will create the appropriate dynamic controller interface to support the new WLAN; then you will enter the necessary WLAN parameters</p>

<li>interface to use.enable an ACL on an interface that processes the packet, in the direction the packet flows</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>through that interface.the router then processes every inbound or outbound IP packet using that ACL</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>Taking Action When a Match Occurs</p>
<ul>
<li>deny or permit<br>
Types of IP ACLs</li>
<li>
<ul>

</li>
<li>Looks at IPv4 packets.<br>
List Logic with IP ACLs</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>router takes the action listed in that line of the ACL and stops looking further in the ACLevery IP ACL has a deny all statement implied at the end of the ACL</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Matching Logic and Command Syntax</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>ACL is one or more accessany number from the ranges shown in the preceding line of syntax. -list commands with the same number,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(One number is no better than the other.) IOS refers to each line in an ACL is an Access Control Entry (ACE</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>engineers just call them ACL statements.each access-list command also lists the action (permit or deny), plus the matching logic.</li>

Practice Building access-list Commands<br>
Tips to consider when choosing matching parameters to any access-list command:</p>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>To match a specific address, just list the address.To match any and all addresses, use the any keyword.</li>
