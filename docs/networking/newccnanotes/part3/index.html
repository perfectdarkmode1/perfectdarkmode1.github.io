<p>Network Address Translation Concepts</p>

<p>the router statically maps 10.1.1.2 to 200.1.1.2. Because the enterprise has a single registered Class C network, it can support at most 254 private IP addresses with NAT, with the usual two<br>
reserved numbers (the network number and network broadcast address).<br>
inside local for the private IP addresses in this example and inside global for the public IP addresses.</p>
<p>Dynamic NAT<br>
Dynamic NAT sets up a pool of possible inside global addresses and defines matching criteria to determine which inside local IP addresses should be translated with NAT.</p>

Because the logic has been configured to match source IP
addresses that begin with 10.1.1, the router adds an entry in the NAT table for 10.1.1.1 as an inside local address.
The NAT router needs to allocate an IP address from the pool of valid inside global addresses. It picks the first one available (200.1.1.1, in this case) and adds it to the NAT table to complete the
entry.
The NAT router translates the source IP address and forwards the packet.
The dynamic entry stays in the table as long as traffic flows occasionally. You can configure a timeout value that defines how long the router should wait, having not translated any packets
with that address, before removing the dynamic entry.entries from the table using the clear ip nat translation You can also * command.manually clear the dynamic
NAT can be configured with more IP addresses in the inside local address list than in the inside global address pool.
If a new packet arrives from yet another inside host, and it needs a NAT entry, but all the pooled IP addresses are in use, the router simply discards the packet. The user must try again until a NAT
entry times out, at which point the NAT function works for the next host that sends a packet. Essentially, the inside global pool of addresses needs to be as large as the maximum number of
concurrent hosts that need to use the Internet at the same timeexplained in the next section. —unless you use PAT, as is</code></pre></div><p>Overloading NAT with Port Address Translation<br>

<p>Static NAT Configuration<br>
Each static mapping between a local (private) address and a global (public) address must be configured.<br>
Those same interface subcommands tell NAT whether the interface is inside or outside.<br>

Dynamic NAT still requires that each interface be identified as either an inside or outside interface<br>

If PAT uses a pool of inside global addresses, the configuration looks exactly like dynamic NAT, except the ip nat inside source list global command has an <strong>overload</strong> keyword added to the end. If<br>

<p>Classification and Marking<br>
a type of QoS tool that by changing some bits in specific header fieldsclassifies packets based on their header contents then marks the message<br>
Classification Basics<br>
QoS tools sit in the path that packets take when being forwarded through a router or switch,<br>
much like the positioning of ACLs. Like ACLs, ACLs, QoS tools are enabled for a direction: packets entering the interface (before the QoS tools are enabled on an interface. Also like<br>
forwarding decision) or for messages exiting the interface (after the forwarding decision).<br>
classification refers to the process of matching the fields in a message to make a choice to<br>
take some QoS action<br>
QoS tools perform classification (matching of header fields) to decide which packets to take certain QoS actions against.Those actions include the other types of QoS tools discussed in<br>
this chapter, such as queuing, shaping, policing, and so on.</p>

Marking the IP Header<br>
Marking a QoS field in the IP header works well with QoS because the IP header exists for the entire trip from the source host to the destination host.<br>
IPv4 defines a Type of Service (ToS) byte in the IPv4 headerThe original RFC defined a 3-bit IP Precedence (IPP) field for QoS marking. That field , as shown in Figure 11-6.<br>
gave us eight separate valueswhen converted to decimal are decimals 0 through 7.—binary 000, 001, 010, and so on, through 111—which</p>

that can be marked. The DiffServ RFCs, which became RFCs back in the late 1990s, have become accepted as the most common method to use when doing QoS, and<br>
using the DSCP field for marking has become quite common.<br>
IPv6 has a similar field to mark as well.The 6-bit field also goes by the name DSCP,<br>
