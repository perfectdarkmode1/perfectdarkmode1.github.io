    <title>Resources I used to Pass CCNA - David Vargas</title>
    <link>http://perfectdarkmode.com/networking/resources_for_passing_ccna/</link>
    <description>There are a lot of great CCNA resources out there. This list does not include all of them. Only the ones that I personally used to pass the CCNA 200-301 exam.&#xA;Materials for CCNA are generally separated into 5 categories:&#xA;Books Video courses Labs Practice test Flashcards Books Wendell Odom OCG Official cert guide library To me, this is the king of CCNA study materials. Some people do not like reading but this will give you more depth than any other resource on this list.</description>
