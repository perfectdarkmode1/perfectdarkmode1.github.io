Description
Two customer premise equip-
ment (CPE) devices can ex-
change Ethernet frames, simi-
lar in concept to a leased line.
This service acts like a LAN, in
that all devices can send
frames to all other devices.
A central site can communicate
to a defined set of remote sites,
but the remote sites cannot
communicate directly. &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>E-Line (point-to-point), E-LAN (full mesh), and E-Tree (point-to-multipoint, hub and spoke)</p>
<p>Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) used for what MEF defines as E-Line service, and Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) used for what MEF defines as E-LAN service and Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS) refer to cases in which the SP uses MPLS internally to create what the customer sees as an Ethernet WAN service.</p>
<h3 id="ethernet-line-service-point-to-point">Ethernet Line Service (Point-to-Point)</h3>
<p>The customer connects two sites with access links. Then the MetroE service allows the two customer devices to send Ethernet frames to each other.</p>

<p>a WAN service that routes IP packets between customer sites</p>
<p>the middle four routers could represent the SPâ€™s MPLS network, with the numbered routers on the edges being routers owned by one company.</p>
<p>the SP builds its IP network to also use Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), in particular MPLS VPNs</p>
<p>allow the SP to build one large MPLS network, which also creates a private IP-based WAN for each of its customers.</p>
<p>The routers on the edge of the MPLS network add and remove an MPLS header to packets as they enter and exit the MPLS network. The devices inside the MPLS network then use the label field inside that MPLS header when forwarding data across the MPLS network. The choices of the labels to use, along with other related logic, allow the MPLS VPN to create separate VPNs to keep different customersâ€™ traffic separate.</p>
<p>layer 3 service but sometimes called a Layer 2.5 protocol because it adds the MPLS header between the data-link header (Layer 2) and the IP header (Layer 3).</p>
<p>SPâ€™s MPLS VPN network:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Will use a routing protocol to build routing protocol neighbor relationships with customer routers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will learn customer subnets/routes with those routing protocols</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will advertise a customerâ€™s routes with a routing protocol so that all routers that customer connects to the MPLS VPN can learn all routes as advertised through the MPLS VPN network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will make decisions about MPLS VPN forwarding, including what MPLS labels to add and remove, based on the customerâ€™s IP address space and customer IP routes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>MPLS VPNs create a private network by keeping customer data separate, but not by encrypting the data.</p>
<h2 id="mpls-vpn-physical-design-and-topology">MPLS VPN Physical Design and Topology</h2>
<p>two important MPLS terms in context: customer edge (CE) and provider edge (PE).</p>

<p>the enterprise will want to work with the SP to define other features of the service. The customer and SP will need to work through the details of some Layer 3 design choices (as discussed in more depth in the next section). The customer will also likely want to ask for QoS services from the MPLS provider and define those details.</p>
<h3 id="layer-3-with-mpls-vpn">Layer 3 with MPLS VPN</h3>
<p>MPLS must be aware of the customer IP addressing. The SP will even use routing protocols and advertise those customer routes across the WAN</p>
<p>CE routers need to exchange routes with the PE routers in the MPLS network. Additionally, all the CE routers need to learn routes from the other CE routersâ€”a process that relies on the PE routers.</p>
<p>MPLS allows for many familiar routing protocols on the edge of the MPLS network: RIPv2, EIGRP, OSPF, and even eBGP</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>The MPLS network does advertise the customerâ€™s routes between the various PE routers so that the CE routers can learn all customer routes through their PE-CE routing protocol neighbor relationship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To advertise the customer routes between the PE routers, the PE routers use another routing protocol along with a process called route redistribution. Route redistribution happens inside one router, taking routes from one routing protocol process and injecting them into another. MPLS does route redistribution in the PE routers between the routing protocol used by the customer and a variation of BGP called Multiprotocol BGP (MPBGP). (Redistribution is needed when the PE-CE routing protocol is not BGP.</p>

<p>Internet VPN Fundamentals</p>
<p>Internet VPNs can provide important security features, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Confidentiality (privacy): Preventing anyone in the middle of the Internet (man in the middle) from being able to read the data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authentication: Verifying that the sender of the VPN packet is a legitimate device and not a device used by an attacker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data integrity: Verifying that the packet was not changed as the packet transited the Internet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anti-replay: Preventing a man in the middle from copying and later replaying the packets sent by a legitimate user, for the purpose of appearing to be a legitimate user</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Host PC1 (10.2.2.2) on the right sends a packet to the web server (10.1.1.1), just as it would without a VPN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The router encrypts the packet, adds some VPN headers, adds another IP header (with public IP addresses), and forwards the packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An attacker in the Internet copies the packet (called a man-in-the-middle attack). However, the attacker cannot change the packet without being noticed and cannot read the contents of the original packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firewall FW1 receives the packet, confirms the authenticity of the sender, confirms that the packet has not been changed, and then decrypts the original packet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server S1 receives the unencrypted packet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>tunnel refers to any protocolâ€™s packet that is sent by encapsulating the packet inside another packet. The term VPN tunnel may or may not imply that the tunnel also uses encryption.</p>
<p>Site-to-Site VPNs with Ipsec</p>
<p>an architecture or framework for security services for IP networks</p>
<p>more generally called IP Security</p>
<p>IPsec defines how two devices, both of which connect to the Internet, can achieve the main goals of a VPN as listed at the beginning of this section: confidentiality, authentication, data integrity, and anti-replay</p>
<p>its role as an architecture allows it to be added to and changed over time as improvements to individual security functions are made.</p>
<p>IPsec encryption uses a pair of encryption algorithms, which are essentially math formulas, to meet a couple of requirements</p>
<p>One to hide (encrypt) the data</p>
<p>Another to re-create (decrypt) the original data based on the encrypted data</p>
<p>if an attacker did happen to decrypt one packet, that information would not give the attacker any advantages in decrypting the other packets.</p>
<p>process for encrypting data for an IPsec VPN</p>
<p>the encryption key is also known as the session key, shared key, or shared session key.</p>
<p>Session Key
F&rsquo; (Encrypted-data, Session-key)
Original
IP Packet
Clear-text Data
Sending Host
Session Key
Original
IP Packet
F(IP Packet, Session-key) Encrypted Data
IP Header VPN Header Encrypted Data</p>
<p>The sending device encapsulates the encrypted data into a packet, which includes the new IP header and VPN header.</p>
<p>The receiving VPN device runs the corresponding decryption formula, using the encrypted data and session keyâ€”the same key value as was used on the sending VPN deviceâ€”to decrypt the data.</p>
<p>devices use some related VPN technology like Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) to create the concept of a tunnel (a virtual link between the routers),</p>
<p>Without IPsec, each GRE tunnel could be used to forward unencrypted traffic over the Internet. IPsec adds the security features to the data that flows over the tunnel</p>
<p>the figure shows IPsec and GRE, but IPsec teams with other VPN technologies as well</p>

<p>Remote Access VPNs with TLS</p>
<p>remote access VPNs often use the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to create a secure VPN session.</p>
<p>TLS provides the security features of HTTP Secure (HTTPS). Todayâ€™s web browsers support HTTPS (with TLS) as a way to dynamically create a secure connection from the web browser to a web server,</p>
<p>To do so, the browser creates a TCP connection to server well-known port 443 (default) and then initializes a TLS session. TLS encrypts data sent between the browser and the server and authenticating the user. Then, the HTTP messages flow over the TLS VPN connection.</p>
<p>SSL has been deprecated (see RFC 7568) and has been replaced by TLS.</p>
<p>each session secures only the data sent in that session</p>
<p>can be used to create a client VPN that secures all packets from the device to a site by using a Cisco VPN client</p>
<p>Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client (or AnyConnect Client for short) is software that sits on a userâ€™s PC and uses TLS to create one end of a VPN remote-access tunnel</p>

<p>while the figure shows a firewall used at the main enterprise site, many types of devices can be used on the server side of a TLS connection as well.</p>
