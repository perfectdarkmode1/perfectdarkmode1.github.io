<p>Connected and Local IPv6 Routes</p>
<p>a router adds IPv6 routes based on the following:</p>
<p>The configuration of IPv6 addresses on working interfaces (connected and local routes)</p>
<p>The direct configuration of a static route (static routes)</p>
<p>The configuration of a routing protocol, like OSPFv3, on routers that share the same data link (dynamic routes)</p>
<p>Rules for Connected and Local Routes</p>
<p>First, the router looks for any configured unicast addresses on any interfaces by looking for the ipv6 address command.</p>
<p>if the interface is working—if the interface has a “line status is up, protocol status is up” notice in the output of the show interfaces command—the router adds both a connected and local route.</p>
<p>Routers do not create connected or local IPv6 routes for link-local addresses.</p>
<p>The connected route represents the subnet connected to the interface, whereas the local route is a host route for only the specific IPv6 address configured on the interface.</p>
<p>Routers create IPv6 routes based on each unicast IPv6 address on an interface, as configured with the ipv6 address command, as follows:</p>
<p>The router creates a route for the subnet (a connected route).</p>
<p>The router creates a host route (/128 prefix length) for the router IPv6 address (a local route).</p>
<p>Routers do not create routes based on the link-local addresses associated with the interface.</p>
<p>Routers remove the connected and local routes for an interface if the interface fails, and they re-add these routes when the interface is again in a working (up/up) state</p>

<p>Static IPv6 Routes</p>
<p>static routes require direct configuration with the ipv6 route command</p>
<p>the ipv6 route command begins with the prefix and prefix length. Then the respective commands list the directions of how this router should forward packets toward that destination subnet or prefix by listing the outgoing interface or the address of the next-hop router.</p>
<p>A static route on R1, for this subnet, will begin with ipv6 route 2001:DB8:1111:2::/64, followed by either the outgoing interface (S0/0/0) or the next-hop IPv6 address, or both.</p>

<p>Example Static Route with a Link-Local Next-Hop Address</p>
<p>ipv6 route command cannot simply refer to a link-local next-hop address by itself because the link-local address does not, by itself, tell the local router which outgoing interface to use.</p>
<p>With a link-local next-hop address, a router cannot work through this same logic, so the outgoing interface must also be configured.</p>

<p>Static Routes over Ethernet Links</p>
<p>To configure a static route that uses an Ethernet interface, the ipv6 route command’s forwarding parameters should always include a next-hop IPv6 address. IOS allows you to configure the ipv6 route command using only the outgoing-interface parameter, without listing a next-hop address. The router will accept the command; however, if that outgoing interface happens to be an Ethernet interface, the router cannot successfully forward IPv6 packets using the route.</p>
<p>To configure the ipv6 route correctly when directing packets out an Ethernet interface, the configuration should use one of these styles:</p>
<p>Refer to the next-hop global unicast address (or unique local address) only</p>
<p>Refer to both the outgoing interface and next-hop global unicast address (or unique local address)</p>
<p>Refer to both the outgoing interface and next-hop link-local address</p>

<p>Static IPv6 Host Routes</p>

Network &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>IOS considers static routes better than OSPF-learned routes by default due to administrative distance. IOS uses the same administrative distance concept and default values for IPv6 as it does for IPv4</p>
<p>IPv6 floating static route floats or moves into and out of the IPv6 routing table depending on whether the better (lower) administrative distance route learned by the routing protocol happens to exist currently.</p>
<p>To implement an IPv6 floating static route, just override the default administrative distance on the static route, making the value larger than the default administrative distance of the routing protocol.</p>
<p>ipv6 route 2001:db8:1111:7::/64 2001:db8:1111:9::3 130 command on R1 would do exactly that, setting the static route’s administrative distance to 130.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting Incorrect Static Routes That Appear in the IPv6 Routing Table</p>
<p>IOS cannot tell if you choose the incorrect outgoing interface, incorrect next-hop address, or incorrect prefix/prefix-length in a static route.</p>
<p>IOS puts the route into the IP routing table—even though the route may not work because of the poorly chosen parameters.</p>
<p>R1 cannot use its own IPv6 address as a next-hop address.</p>
<p>routes may have incorrect parameters. Check for these types of mistakes:</p>
<p>Step 1. Prefix/Length: Does the ipv6 route command reference the correct subnet ID (prefix) and mask (prefix length)?</p>
<p>Step 2. If using a next-hop IPv6 address that is a link-local address:</p>
<p>A. Is the link-local address an address on the correct neighboring router? (It should be an address on another router on a shared link.)</p>
<p>B. Does the ipv6 route command also refer to the correct outgoing interface on the local router?</p>
<p>Step 3. If using a next-hop IPv6 address that is a global unicast or unique local address, is the address the correct unicast address of the neighboring router?</p>
<p>Step 4. If referencing an outgoing interface, does the ipv6 route command reference the interface on the local router (that is, the same router where the static route is configured)?</p>
<p>The Static Route Does Not Appear in the IPv6 Routing Table</p>
<p>IOS makes the following checks before adding the route;</p>
<p>For ipv6 route commands that list an outgoing interface, that interface must be in an up/up state.</p>
<p>For ipv6 route commands that list a global unicast or unique local next-hop IP address (that is, not a link-local address), the local router must have a route to reach that next-hop address.</p>
<p>If another IPv6 route exists for that exact same prefix/prefix-length, the static route must have a better (lower) administrative distance.</p>
<p>The Neighbor Discovery Protocol</p>
<p>with 1pv4 ARP works as a separate protocol; with IPv6, the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), a part of ICMPv6, performs the same functions.</p>
<p>few of the functions of the NDP protocol (RFC 4861). Some of those NDP functions are</p>
<p>Neighbor MAC Discovery: An IPv6 LAN-based host will need to learn the MAC address of other hosts in the same subnet. NDP replaces IPv4’s ARP, providing messages that replace the ARP Request and Reply messages.</p>
<p>Router Discovery: Hosts learn the IPv6 addresses of the available IPv6 routers in the same subnet.</p>
<p>SLAAC: When using Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC), the host uses NDP messages to learn the subnet (prefix) used on the link plus the prefix length.</p>
<p>DAD: Before using an IPv6 address, hosts use NDP to perform a Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) process, to ensure no other host uses the same IPv6 address before attempting to use it.</p>
<p>Discovering Neighbor Link Addresses with NDP NS and NA</p>
<p>using a pair of matched solicitation and advertisement messages: the Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages.</p>
<p>the NS acts like an IPv4 ARP request, asking the host with a particular unicast IPv6 address to send back a reply. The NA message acts like an IPv4 ARP Reply, listing that host’s MAC address.</p>
<p>Neighbor Solicitation (NS): This message asks the host with a particular IPv6 address (the target address) to reply with an NA message that lists its MAC address. The NS message is sent to the solicited-node multicast address associated with the target address, so the message is processed only by hosts whose last six hex digits match the address that is being queried.</p>
<p>Neighbor Advertisement (NA): This message lists the sender’s IPv6 and MAC addresses. It can be sent in reply to an NS message, and if so, the packet is sent to the IPv6 unicast address of the host that sent the original NS message. A host can also send an unsolicited NA, announcing its IPv6 and MAC addresses, in which case the message is sent to the all-IPv6-hosts local-scope multicast address FF02::1.</p>

<p>Discovering Routers with NDP RS and RA</p>
<p>NDP defines two messages that allow any host to discover all routers in the subnet:</p>
<p>Router Solicitation (RS): This message is sent to the “all-IPv6-routers” local-scope multicast address of FF02::2 so that the message asks all routers, on the local link only, to identify themselves.</p>
<p>Router Advertisement (RA): This message, sent by the router, lists many facts, including the link-local IPv6 address of the router. When sent in response to an RS message, it flows back to either the unicast address of the host that sent the RS or to the all-IPv6-hosts address FF02::1. Routers also send RA messages without being asked, sent to the all-IPv6-hosts local-scope multicast address of FF02::1.</p>

<p>also periodically send unsolicited RA messages</p>
<p>the RA messages flow to the FF02::1 all-nodes IPv6 multicast address.</p>
<p>Using SLAAC with NDP RS and RA</p>
<p>IPv6 supports an alternative method for IPv6 hosts to dynamically choose an unused IPv6 address to use</p>
<p>The process goes by the name Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).</p>
<p>Learn the IPv6 prefix used on the link, from any router, using NDP RS/RA messages.</p>
<p>Build an address from the prefix plus an interface ID, chosen either by using EUI-64 rules or as a random value.</p>
<p>Before using the address, first use DAD to make sure that no other host is already using the same address.</p>

<p>Discovering Duplicate Addresses Using NDP NS and NA</p>
<p>IPv6 uses the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) process before using a unicast address to make sure that no other node on that link is already using the address. Hosts use DAD not only at the end of the SLAAC process, but also any time that a host interface initializes, no matter whether using SLAAC, DHCP, or static address configuration. When performing DAD, if another host already uses that address, the first host simply does not use the address until the problem is resolved.</p>
<p>a host sends an NS message for its own IPv6 address. No other host should be using that address, so no other host should send an NDP NA in reply. However, if another host already uses that address, that host will reply with an NA, identifying a duplicate use of the address.</p>
<p>Hosts do the DAD check for each of their unicast addresses, link-local addresses included, both when the address is first used and each time the host’s interface comes up.</p>
<p>NDP Summary</p>
<p>NDP does more than what is listed in this chapter, and the protocol allows for addition of other functions, so NDP might continue to grow over time. For now, use Table 25-3 as a study reference for the four NDP features discussed here.</p>
