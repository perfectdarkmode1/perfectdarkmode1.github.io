      <description>It took me a whopping 2 years to finish my CCNA! I kept giving up and quitting my studies for months at a time. Why? Because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember the massive amount of content covered in the CCNA. It felt hopeless. I could have done it in 6 month (or faster) if I knew how to study.
I hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken a test in 10 years before this. So I had completely forgotten how to learn.</description>

1.0 Network Fundamentals
1.8 Configure and verify IPv6 addressing and prefix
Introduction to IPv6
IPv6 increases the address to 128 bits in length.
Older OSPF Version 2 Upgraded to OSPF Version 3:
a newer version, OSPF version 3, was created to support IPv6. (Note: OSPFv3 was later upgraded to support advertising both IPv4 and IPv6 routes.)
ICMP Upgraded to ICMP Version 6:

1.9.f Modified EUI 64
Configuring the Full 128-Bit Address
To statically configure the full 128-bit unicast address—either global unicast or unique local—the router needs an ipv6 address address/prefix-length interface subcommand on each interface. The address can be an abbreviated IPv6 address or the full 32-digit hex address.</description>

The on keyword tells the switches to place a physical interface into an EtherChannel, and The number identifies the PortChannel interface number that the interface should be a part of. EtherChannel, PortChannel, and Channel-group basically mean the same thing. channel-group number on the neighboring switch can differ.</description>

      <description>Spanning Tree Protocol Prevents loops in a network. Loops can create Broadcast storms, Mac table instability, and Multiple frame transmission. Broadcast Storms Switch receives a broadcast frame. Switch transmits that frame out of all ports. The broadcast frames will keep being received on each switch then broadcasted again. Mac Table instability Broadcast storm is causing broadcast packets going in and out of every port, the Switch has to keep updating the source mac address of those packets.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the CCNA OSPF lab. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to configure OSPF so that there are full routing capabilities in the network. As well as use show commands to verify your network. Then you will troubleshoot and fix a broken OSPF network.
Once again, this will all be done in Packet Tracer. But feel free to do this lab on real equipment, GNS-3, etc.

4.7 Explain the forwarding per-hop behavior (PHB) for QoS such as classification, marking, queuing, congestion, policing, shaping
QoS defines these actions as per-hop behaviors (PHBs), which is a formal term to refer to actions other than storing and forwarding a message.
QoS: Managing Bandwidth, Delay, Jitter, and Loss four characteristics of network traffic:
Bandwidth
refers to the speed of a link, in bits per second (bps)
helps to also think of bandwidth as the capacity of the link, in terms of how many bits can be sent over the link per second.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of great CCNA resources out there. This list does not include all of them. Only the ones that I personally used to pass the CCNA 200-301 exam.
Materials for CCNA are generally separated into 5 categories:
Books Video courses Labs Practice test Flashcards Books Wendell Odom OCG Official cert guide library To me, this is the king of CCNA study materials. Some people do not like reading but this will give you more depth than any other resource on this list.</description>

      <description>The configuration of IP addresses differs in some ways, with switches using a VLAN interface and routers using an IP address configured on each working interface.
switches do not have auxiliary ports.
Layer 2 switches support the show mac address-table command, while Cisco routers do not.
routers support the show ip route command, while Cisco Layer 2 switches do not.
Layer 2 switches use the show interfaces status command to list one line of output per interface (and routers do not)</description>

      <description>A. Use the sdm prefer lanbase-routing command (or similar) in global configuration mode to change the switch forwarding ASIC settings to make space for IPv4 routes at the next reload of the switch.
B. Use the reload EXEC command in enable mode to reload (reboot) the switch to pick up the new sdm prefer command setting.
C. Once reloaded, use the ip routing command in global configuration mode to enable the IPv4 routing function in IOS software and to enable key commands like show ip route.</description>

      <description>Problem Isolation Using the ping Command
functions as part of Layer 3, as a control protocol to assist IP by helping manage the IP network functions.
Ping options
The name or IP address of the destination,
how many times the command should send an echo request,
how long the command should wait (timeout) for an echo reply,
how big to make the packets, and many other options.
Extended ping allows R1’s ping command to use R1’s LAN IP address from within subnet 172.</description>

      <description>Virtual LAN (VLAN) Concepts Using VLANs creates smaller broadcast domains. There are many reasons why you would want to do this. You reduce CPU overhead on each device. And reduce security risks by using different security policies on each VLAN.
You can also use more flexible designs that group users by department instead of by physical location. Using VLANs helps you solve problems more quickly. As the failure point for many problems would include devices in a single broadcast domain.</description>

      <description>VLANs create smaller broadcast domains. Why create smaller broadcast domains?
Device have to do less stuff (process less broadcasts) Better security Group different departments together Narrow down problems Less spanning tree if you reduce vlan to a single switch 802.1q tagging
Frames are tagged with an 802.1q header as they leave the switch. So the receiving switch knows what vlan the frame is part of.
802.1q header
4 bytes Includes 12 bit vlan id field that supports 4096 vlans.</description>

Autonomous AP Architecture
VLANs must be trunked from the distribution layer switch (where routing commonly takes place) to the access layer, where they are extended further over a trunk link to the AP.
Two wireless users that are associated to the same autonomous AP can reach each other through the AP without having to pass up into the wired network</description>

Comparing Wired and Wireless Networks
Wireless devices must adhere to a common standard (IEEE 802.11).
Wireless coverage must exist in the area where devices are expected to use it.
Wireless LAN Topologies
IEEE 802.11 WLANs are always half duplex because transmissions between stations use the same frequency or channel.</description>

A comprehensive approach to wireless security focuses on the following areas:
Identifying the endpoints of a wireless connection
Identifying the end user (authentication)
Protecting the wireless data from eavesdroppers (encryption)
Protecting the wireless data from tampering (integrity)
Authentication
To use a wireless network, clients must first discover a basic service set (BSS) and then request permission to associate with it.</description>
