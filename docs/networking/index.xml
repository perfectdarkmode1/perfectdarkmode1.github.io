      <description>It took me a whopping 2 years to finish my CCNA! I kept giving up and quitting my studies for months at a time. Why? Because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember the massive amount of content covered in the CCNA. It felt hopeless. I could have done it in 6 month (or faster) if I knew how to study.
I hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken a test in 10 years before this. So I had completely forgotten how to learn.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of great CCNA resources out there. This list does not include all of them. Only the ones that I personally used to pass the CCNA 200-301 exam.
Materials for CCNA are generally separated into 5 categories:
Books Video courses Labs Practice test Flashcards Books Wendell Odom OCG Official cert guide library To me, this is the king of CCNA study materials. Some people do not like reading but this will give you more depth than any other resource on this list.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed with options after completing your CCNA. What do you learn next? If you are trying to get a job as a Network Engineer, you will want to check this out.
I went through dozens of job listings that mentioned CCNA. Then, tallied up the main devices/vendors, certifications, and technologies mentioned. And left out anything that wasn&amp;rsquo;t mentioned more than twice.
Core CCNA technologies such as LAN, WAN, OSPF, Spanning Tree, VLANs, etc.</description>
