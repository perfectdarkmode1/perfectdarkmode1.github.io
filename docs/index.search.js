    "content": " It took me a whopping 2 years to finish my CCNA! I kept giving up and quitting my studies for months at a time. Why? Because I couldn’t remember the massive amount of content covered in the CCNA. It felt hopeless. I could have done it in 6 month (or faster) if I knew how to study.\nI hadn’t taken a test in 10 years before this. So I had completely forgotten how to learn. This post is about the mistakes I made studying for the CCNA and how to avoid them.\nYou will also learn, as I did, about spaced repetition. I’ve also included a 6 month CCNA spaced repetition calendar.\nMy Mistakes, So You Don’t Make Them Mistake #1 Didn’t start flashcards until the final 30 days I wish I would have started flashcards from day 1. This would have helped a crap ton. Remembering all of the little details is not only useful for taking the test. It embeds the concepts in your brain and keeps you processing how things work .\nIf there is anything you take from this list. You should definitely be doing some flashcards every day.\nMistake #2 Not enough labs as I went. While studying the OCG and video courses. I did some labs. But I also skipped a ton of labs because it wasn’t convenient at the time. Then I was forced to lab every single topic in the final 30 days. A lot of cramming was done..\nMake sure to do all of the labs as you go. Make up your own labs as well. This is very important to building job worthy skills.\nMistake #3 Didn’t have a plan or stick with it. When your plan consists of, “just read everything and watch the videos and take the test when you feel ready”, you tend to procrastinate and put things off. Make a study schedule and a solid plan. (See below)\nHaving a set date for when you will take the test was pretty motivating. I did not find this out until about 30 days until my test.\nSpaced Repetition If you are using Anki flashcards for your studies, you may already be using spaced repetition. Spaced repetition is repeatedly reviewing with the time in between reviews getting longer each time you review it.\nHere is an excellent article about our learning curves and why spaced repetition helps us remember things https://fs.blog/spacing-effect/\nHow to set up a spaced repetition calendar for CCNA. Step 1. Plan how long your studies will take\nFigure out how long you need. It usually takes around 240 hours of studying for CCNA. (Depending on experience). Then figure out how many hours per day that you can spend on studying. This example is based on a 6 month study calendar.\nYou can use this 6 month excel calendar to plan and track your progress. You. can still use this method If you have already been studying CCNA. Just edit your calendar for how much time you have left.\nThe calendar is also based on Wendel Odom’s Official Cert Guide. You will also want to mix your other resources into your reviews.\nDecide what your review sessions will be\nPlan to review each chapter 3-4 times. here is what I did for review sessions to pass the exam.\nReview 1 Read and highlight (and flashcards)\nRead the chapter. Highlight key information that you want to remember. Do a lab for the material you studied (if applicable) Answer DIKTA questions Start Chapter 1 Anki Flascards Review 2 Copy highlights over to OneNote (keep doing flashcards)\nCopy your highlights over to OneNote. (using copy and paste if you have the digital book) Read your highlights and make sure you understand everything. lab and continue doing flashcards. (just go through Anki suggested flashcards, not just ones for the specific chapter.) Review 3 Labs and Highlight your notes (and flashcards)\nMore labs!\nGo over your notes. Color coding everything. (You can find my jumbled note mess here)\nGreen: Read again\nTeal: Very important Learn this/ lab it.\nRed/ purple: make extra flashcards out of this.\nReview 4 Practice questions and review\nGo through and answer the DIKTA questions again. Review any missed answers. Lab anything you aren’t quite sure of. The final 30 days\nI HIGHLY recommend Boson ExSim for your final 30 days of studying. ExSim comes with 3 exams (A,B, and C). Start with exam A in test simulation mode. Leave about a week in between each practice exam so you can go over your answers and Boson’s explanations for each answer.\nOne week before your test, (after you’ve completed exams A,B, and C). Do a random exam. Make sure you do the timed version that don’t show your score as you go.\nYou should be scoring above 900 by your 3rd and 4th exam if you have been reviewing Boson’s answer explanations.\nSchedule your exam\nPearson view didn’t let me schedule the exam past 30 days out from when I wanted to take it. I’m not sure if this is the case all the time. But by the time you are 30 days out you should have your test scheduled. This will light the fire under you. Great motivation for the home stretch.\nIf your exam is around June during Cisco Live, Cisco usually offers a 50% discount for an exam voucher. You probably won’t find any other discounts unless you pay for Cisco’s specific CCNA training.\nFinal word on labs You can technically pass the CCNA without doing many labs. But this will leave you at a HUGE disadvantage in the job market. Labs are crucial for really understanding networking. Knowing your way around the CLI and being able to troubleshoot networking issues will make you stand out from those who crammed for the exam.\nIf you’ve made it this far I really appreciate you taking the time to read this post. I really hope it helps at least one person.",

    "content": " There are a lot of great CCNA resources out there. This list does not include all of them. Only the ones that I personally used to pass the CCNA 200-301 exam.\nMaterials for CCNA are generally separated into 5 categories:\nBooks Video courses Labs Practice test Flashcards Books Wendell Odom OCG Official cert guide library To me, this is the king of CCNA study materials. Some people do not like reading but this will give you more depth than any other resource on this list. Link.\nTodd Lammle Books Yes, I read both the OCG and Todd Lammle books cover to cover. No, I do not recommend doing this. Todd has a great way of adding humor into networking. If you need to build up your networking from the ground up. These books are great. Link.\nVideo Courses CBT Nuggets Jeremy Ciara makes learning networking so much fun. This was a great course but is not enough for you to pass the exam on it’s own. Also, a CBT nuggets monthly subscription will set you back $59 per month. Link.\nJeremy’s IT Lab Jermey’s IT lab course was the most informative for me. Jeremy is really great at explaining the more complex topics. Jeremy’s course also includes Packet Tracer labs and and in depth Anki flashcard deck for free. Link.\nLabs David Bombal’s Packet Tracer Labs These labs will really make you think. Although they do steer off the exam objectives a bit. Link.\nJeremy’s IT labs These were my favorite labs by far. Very easy to set up with clear instructions and video explanations. Link.\nPractice test Boson Exsim I can’t stress this enough. if there is one resource that you invest some money into. it’s the Boson practice exams. This is a test simulator that is very close to what the actual test will be like. Exsim comes with 3 exams.\nAfter taking one of these practice tests you will get a breakdown of your scores per category. You will also get to go through all of your questions and see detailed explantations for why each answer is right or wrong.\nThese practice exams were crucial for me to understand where my knowledge gaps were. Link.\nSubnettingpractice.com You can learn subnetting pretty good. Then forget some of the steps a month later and have to learn all over again. It was very helpful to go over some of these subnetting questions once in a while. Link.\nFlashcards Anki Deck These are the only flashcards I used. It is very nice not to have to create your own flashcards. Having the Anki app on your phone is very convenient. You can study whenever you have a few minutes of downtime.\nAnki also used spaced-repetition. It will give you harder flashcards more often based on how you rate their difficulty.\nThis particular deck goes along with the OCG. You can filter by chapter and add more as you get through the book.\nI will be using Anki flashcards for every exam in the future. Link.\nMy Top 3 Be careful not to use too many resources. You may get a bit overwhelmed. Especially if this is your first certification like it was for me. You will be building study habits and learning how to read questions correctly. So focus on quality over quantity.\nIf I had to study for the CCNA again, I would use these three resources:\nOCG Boson Exsim Anki Flashcards If you like these posts, please let me know so i can keep making more like them!",

    "content": " We are going to use Vagrant to set up two RHEL 8 servers with some custom configuration options. I will include some helpful Vagrant commands at the end if you get stuck.\nIn this guide, I will be using Fedora 38 as my main operating system. I use Fedora because it is similar in features to Red Hat Linux Distributions. This will give me even more practice for the RHCSA exam as I use it in day-to-day operations.\nNote, if you are using Windows, you will need to install ssh. This can be done by installing Git. Which automatically installs ssh for you.\nYou will also need to have the latest version of Virtualbox installed.\nHere are the steps: Download and install Vagrant Make a new directory for your vagrant lab to live in Add the vagrant box Install the Vagrant disk size plugin Initialize the Vagrant box and Edit the Vagrant file Bring up the Vagrant box 1. Download and install Vagrant. In Fedora, this is very easy. Run the following command to download and install Vagrant:\nsudo dnf install vagrant\n2. Make a new directory for your vagrant lab to live in. Make your vagrant directory and make it your current working directory:\ncd Vagrant Add the Vagrant box. vagrant box add generic/rhel8\nInstall the Vagrant disk size plugin. The disk size program will help us set up custom storage sizes. Since we will be re-partitioning storage, this is a useful feature.\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize\nInitialize the Vagrant box and edit the Vagrant file. First, initialize the Vagrant box in the vagrant directory: vagrant init generic/rhel8\nAfter completion, there will now be a file called “Vagrantfile” in your current directory. Since Vim is on the RHCSA exam, it’s wise to practice with it whenever you can. So let’s open the file in Vim:\nvim Vagrantfile\nYou will see a bunch of lines commented out, and a few lines without comments. Go ahead and comment out everything and paste this at the end of the file:\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config config.vm.box = \"generic/rhel8\" config.vm.define \"server1\" do |server1| server1.vm.hostname = \"server1.example.com\" server1.vm.network \"private_network\", ip: \"192.168.2.110\" config.disksize.size = '10GB' end config.vm.define \"server2\" do |server2| server2.vm.hostname = \"server2.example.com\" server2.vm.network \"private_network\", ip: \"192.168.2.120\" config.disksize.size = '16GB' end config.vm.provider \"virtualbox\" do |vb| vb.memory = \"2048\" end end|The configuration file is fairly self-explanatory. Save Vagrantfile and exit Vim. Then, create /etc/vbox/networks.conf and add the following:\n* 10.0.0.0/8 192.168.0.0/1 * 2001::/646This will allow you to be more flexible with what network addresses can be used in VirtualBox.\nBring up the Vagrant box. Now, we bring up the Vagrant box. This will open two Virtual machines in Virtualbox named server1 and server2 in headless mode (there is no GUI).\nvagrant up\nGreat! Now we can use Vagrant to ssh into server1:\nvagrant ssh server 1\nFrom server1 ssh into server2 using its IP address:\n[vagrant@server1 ~]$ ssh 192.168.2.120\nNow you are in and ready to stir things up. The last thing you need is some commands to manage your Vagrant machines.\nHelpful Vagrant commands. Shut down Vagrant machines:\nvagrant halt Suspend or resume a machine:\nvagrant suspend vagrand resumeRestart a virtual machine:\nvagrant reload\nDestroy a Vagrant machine:\nvagrant destroy [machine-name]\nShow running VMs:\nvagrant status\nList other Vagrant options:\nvagrant\nIf you are going for RHCSA, there is no doubt that you will also use Vagrant sometime in the future. And as you can see, it’s pretty quick and simple to get started.\nFeel free to reach out with questions.",

If you are trying to get a job as a Network Engineer, you will want to check this out.\nI went through dozens of job listings that mentioned CCNA. Then, tallied up the main devices/vendors, certifications, and technologies mentioned. And left out anything that wasn’t mentioned more than twice.\nCore CCNA technologies such as LAN, WAN, OSPF, Spanning Tree, VLANs, etc. have been left out. The point here is to target the most sought after technologies and skills by employers. I also left out soft skills and any job that wasn’t a networking specific role.\nDevices/ Vendors Palo Alto is huge! I’m not suprised by this. Depending on the company, a network engineer may be responsible for firewall configuration and troubleshooting. It also looks like Network Engineers with a wide variety of skills are saught after.\nDevice/Vendor Times Mentioned Palo Alto 9 Cisco ASA 6 Juniper 6 Office 365 5 Meraki 4 Vmware 4 Linux 4 Ansible 4 AWS 3 Wireshark 3 Technologies Firewall comes in first again. Followed closely by VPN skills. Every interview I had for a Network Engineer position asked if I knew how to configure and troubleshoot VPNs.\nTechnology Times Mentioned Firewall 19 VPN 16 Wireless 12 BGP 12 Security 12 MPLS 10 Load balancers 8 Ipsec 7 ISE 6 DNS 5 SDWAN 5 Cloud 4 TACACS+ 4 ACL 4 SIEM 4 IDS/IPS 4 RADIUS 3 ITIL 3 Ipam 3 VOIP 3 EIGRP 3 Python 3 Certifications CCNP blew every other cert out of the water.

Security + comes highly recommended as well.\nCertification Times Mentioned CCNP 18 Security+ 6 JNCIA 4 JNCIP 4 Network + 4 CCIE 4 PCNSA 3 So what do you do after CCNA? It depends…\nAre you trying to get a new job ASAP? Are there opportunities at your current role that you can use your new skills to leverage? Do you have some study time before you are ready to take the next step?\nCCNP Enterprise is a good bet if you really want to stand out in Network Engineering interviews.\nDon’t want to be a Network engineer? Continue to build a good base of IT skills. This will open you up to a larger variety of jobs and open skill paths that you need a good foundation to unlock.\nCore skills include:\nLinux/ Operating systems Networking General Cybersecurity Programming/ Scripting A good Linux certification like the RHCSA would be great to learn more about Linux, scripting, and operating systems. Security + would be good if you want to get a solid foundation of cyber security. And Python skills will give you a gold star in any IT interview.\nDon’t get paralyzed by choices. Pick something that interests you and go for it. That is the only way to get it right. Doing what you enjoy is better than not doing anything at all because you can’t decide the best path.\nHopefully we can revisit this post after learning Python to get a much bigger sample size.",

    "content": "This is a step-by-step guide to setting up Nextcloud on a Debian server. You will need a server hosted by a VPS like Vultr. And a Domain hosted by a DNS provider such as Cloudflare\nWhat is Nextcloud? Nextcloud is so many things. It offers so many features and options, it deserves a bulleted list:\nFree and open source Cloud storage and syncing Email client Custom browser dashboard with widgets Office suite RSS newsfeed Project organization (deck) Notebook Calender Task manager Connect to decentralized social media (like Mastodon) Replacement for all of google’s services Create web forms or surveys It is also free and open source. This mean the source code is available to all. And hosting yourself means you can guarantee that your data isn’t being shared.\nAs you can see. Nextcloud is feature packed and offers an all in one solution for many needs. The set up is fairly simple!\nInstall Dependencies sudo apt update Sury Dependencies sudo apt install software-properties-common ca-certificates lsb-release apt-transport-https Enable Sury Repository sudo sh -c 'echo \"deb https://packages.sury.org/php/ $(lsb_release -sc) main\" \u003e /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list' Import the GPG key for the repository wget -qO - https://packages.sury.org/php/apt.gpg | sudo apt-key add - Install PHP 8.2 https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-php-8-2-on-debian/?expand_article=1 (This is also part of the other dependencies install command below)\nsudo apt install php8.2 Install other dependencies: apt install -y nginx python3-certbot-nginx mariadb-server php8.2 php8.2-{fpm,bcmath,bz2,intl,gd,mbstring,mysql,zip,xml,curl}Improving Nextcloud server performance Adding more child processes for PHP to use:\nvim /etc/php/8.2/fpm/pool.d/www.conf # update the following parameters in the file pm = dynamic pm.max_children = 120 pm.start_servers = 12 pm.min_spare_servers = 6 pm.max_spare_servers = 18Start your MariaDB server: systemctl enable mariadb --nowSet up a SQL Database Nextcloud needs some tables setup in order to store information in a database. First set up a secure sql database:\nmysql_secure_installationSay “Yes” to the prompts and enter root password:\nSwitch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n]: Y Change the root password? [Y/n]: Y\t# enter password. Remove anonymous users? [Y/n]: Y Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n]: Y Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n]: Y Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]: YSign in to your SQL database with the password you just chose:\nmysql -u root -pCreating a database for NextCloud While signed in with the mysql command, enter the commands below one at a time. Make sure to replace the username and password. But leave localhost as is:\nCREATE DATABASE nextcloud; GRANT ALL ON nextcloud.* TO 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; EXIT;Install SSL with Certbot Obtain an SSL certificate. See my website setup post for information about Certbot and nginx setup.\ncertbot certonly --nginx -d nextcloud.example.comCreate a CNAME record for DNS. You will need to have a domain name set up for your server. I use Cloudflare to manage my DNS records. You will want to make a CNAME record for your nextcloud subdomain.\nJust add “nextcloud” as the name and “yourwebsite.com” as the content. This will make it so “nextcloud.yourwebsite.com”. Make sure to select “DNS Only” under proxy status.\nNginx Setup Edit your sites-available config at /etc/nginx/sites-available/nextcloud. See comments in the following text box:\nvim /etc/nginx/sites-available/nextcloud # Add this to the file: # replace example.org with your domain name # use the following vim command to make this easier # :%s/example.org/perfectdarkmode.com/g # ^ this will replace all instances of example.org with perfectdarkmode.com.

Here is a guide on troubleshooting with occ. The basic command is as follows:\nsudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occAdd this as an alias in ~/.bashrc for ease of use.\nYou are ready to log in to Nextcloud! Go to your nextcloud domain in a browser. In my case, I head to nextcloud.perfectdarkmode.com. Fill out the form to create your first Nextcloud user:\nChoose an admin username and secure password. Leave Data folder as the default value. For Database user, enter the user you set for the SQL database. For Database password, enter the password you chose for the new user in MariaDB. For Database name, enter: nextcloud Leave “localhost” as “localhost”. Click Finish. Now that you are signed in. Here are a few things you can do to start you off:\nDownload the desktop and mobile app and sync all of your data. (covered below) Look at different apps to consolodate your programs all in one place. Put the Nextcloud dashboard as your default browser homepage and customize themes. Set up email integration. NextCloud desktop synchronization Install the desktop client (Fedora)\nSudo dnf install nextcloudclientInstall on other distros: https://help.nextcloud.com/t/install-nextcloud-client-for-opensuse-arch-linux-fedora-ubuntu-based-android-ios/13657\nRun the nextcloud desktop app and sign in. Choose folders to sync. Folder will be ~/Nextcloud. Move everything into your nextcloud folder. This may break things with filepaths so beware. Now you are ready to use and explore nextcloud. Here is a video from TechHut to get you started down the NextCloud rabbit hole.\nChange max upload size (default is 500mg) /var/www/nextcloud/.user.ini php_value upload_max_filesize = 16G php_value post_max_size = 16G\nRemove file locks Put Nextcloud in maintenance mode: Edit config/config.php and change this line:\n'maintenance' =\u003e true,\nEmpty table oc_file_locks: Use tools such as phpmyadmin or connect directly to your database and run (the default table prefix is oc_, this prefix can be different or even empty):\nDELETE FROM oc_file_locks WHERE 1\ndisable maintenance mode (undo first step).

    "content": "Word Press is great, but it is probably a lot more bloated then you need for a personal website. Enter Hugo, it has less server capacity and storage needs than Word Press. Hugo is a static site generator than takes markdown files and converts them to html.\nHosting your own website is also a lot cheaper than having a provider like Bluehost do it for you. Instead of $15 per month, I am currently paying $10 per year.\nThis guide will walk through building a website step-by-step.\nSetting up a Virtual Private Server (VPS) Registering a domain name Pointing the domain to your server Setting up hugo on your local PC Syncing your Hugo generate site with your server Using nginx to serve your site Enable http over SSL Setting up a Virtual Private Server (VPS) I use Vultr as my VPS. When I signed up they had a $250 credit towards a new account. If you select the cheapest server (you shouldn’t need anything else for a basic site) that comes out to about $6 a month. Of course the $250 credit goes towards that which equates to around 41 months free.\nHead to vultr.com. Create and account and Select the Cloud Compute option.\nUnder CPU \u0026 Storage Technology, select “Regular Performance”. Then under “Server Location, select the server closest to you. Or closest to where you think your main audience will be.\nUnder Server image, select the OS you are most comfortable with. This guide uses Debian.\nUnder Server Size, slect the 10GB SSD. Do not select the “IPv6 ONLY” option. Leave the other options as default and enter your server hostname.\nOn the products page, click your new server. You can find your server credentials and IPv4 address here. You will need these to log in to your server.\nLog into your sever via ssh to test. From a Linux terminal run:\nssh username@serveripaddressThen, enter your password when prompted.\nRegistering a Domain Name I got my domain perfectdarkmode.com from Cloudflare.com for about $10 per year. You can check to see available domains there. You can also check https://www.namecheckr.com/ to see iof that name is available on various social media sites.\nIn CloudFlare, just click “add a site” and pick a domain that works for you. Next, you will need your server address from earlier.\nUnder domain Registration, click “Manage Domains”, click “manage” on your domain. One the sidebar to the right, there is a qucik actions menu. Click “update DNS configuration”.\nClick “Add record”. Type is an “A” record. Enter the name and the ip address that you used earlier for your server. Uncheck “Proxy Status” and save.\nYou can check to see if your DNS has updated on various DNS severs at https://dnschecker.org/. Once those are up to date (after a couple minutes) you should be able to ping your new domain.\n[davidthomas@fedora posts]$ ping perfectdarkmode.com PING perfectdarkmode.com (104.238.140.131) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 104.238.140.131.vultrusercontent.com (104.238.140.131): icmp_seq=1 ttl=53 time=33.2 ms 64 bytes from 104.238.140.131.vultrusercontent.com (104.238.140.131): icmp_seq=2 ttl=53 time=28.2 ms 64 bytes from 104.238.140.131.vultrusercontent.com (104.238.140.131): icmp_seq=3 ttl=53 time=31.0 msNow, you can use the same ssh command to ssh into your vultr serverusing your domain name.\nssh username@domain.comSetting up hugo on your local PC Hugo is a popular open-source static site generator. It allows you to take markdown files, and builds them into and html website. To start go to https://gohugo.io/installation/ and download Hugo on your local computer. (I will show you how to upload the site to your server later.)\nPick a theme The theme I use is here https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/\nYou can browse your own themes as well. Just make sure to follow the installation instructions. Let’s create a new Hugo site. Change into the directory where you want your site to be located in. Mine rests in ~/Documents/.\ncd ~/Documents/Create your new Hugo site.\nhugo new site site-nameThis will make a new folder with your site name in the ~/Documents directory. This folder will have a few directories and a config file in it.\narchetypes config.toml content data layouts public resources static themesFor this tutorial, we will be working with the config.toml file and the content, public, static, and themes. Next, load the theme into your site directory. For the Hello Friend NG theme:\ngit clone https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git themes/hello-friend-ngNow we will load the example site into our working site. Say yes to overwrite.\ncp -a themes/hello-friend-ng/exampleSite/* .The top of your new config.toml site now contains:\nbaseURL = \"https://example.com\" title = \"Hello Friend NG\" languageCode = \"en-us\" theme = \"hello-friend-ng\"Replace your baseURL with your site name and give your site a title. Set the enableGlobalLanguageMenu option to false if you want to remove the language swithcer option at the top. I also set enableThemeToggle to true so users could set the theme to dark or light.\nYou can also fill in the links to your social handles. Comment out any lines you don’t want with a “#” like so:\n[params.social](params.social) name = \"twitter\" url = \"https://twitter.com/\" [params.social](params.social) name = \"email\" url = \"mailto:nobody@example.com\" [params.social](params.social) name = \"github\" url = \"https://github.com/\" [params.social](params.social) name = \"linkedin\" url = \"https://www.linkedin.com/\" # [params.social](params.social) # name = \"stackoverflow\" # url = \"https://www.stackoverflow.com/\"You may also want to edit the footer text to your liking. I commented out the second line that comes with the example site:\n[params.footer] trademark = true rss = true copyright = true author = true topText = [] bottomText = [ # \"Powered by \u003ca href=\\\"http://gohugo.io\\\"\u003eHugo\u003c/a\u003e\", # \"Made with \u0026#10084; by \u003ca href=\\\"https://github.com/rhazdon\\\"\u003eDjordje Atlialp\u003c/a\u003e\" ]Now, move the contents of the example contents folder over to your site’s contents folder (giggidy):\ncp -r ~/Documents/hugo/themes/hello-friend-ng/exampleSite/content/* ~/Documents/hugo/content/Let’s clean up a little bit. Cd into ~/Documents/hugo/content/posts. Rename the file to the name of your first post. Also, delete all of the other files here:\ncd ~/Documents/hugo/contents/posts mv goisforlovers.md newpostnamehere.md find . ! -name 'newpostnamehere.md' -type f -exec rm -f {} +Open the new post file and delete everything after this:\n+++ title = \"Building a Minimalist Website with Hugo\" description = \"\" type = [\"posts\",\"post\"] tags = [ \"hugo\", \"nginx\", \"ssl\", \"http\", \"vultr\", ] date = \"2023-03-26\" categories = [ \"tools\", \"linux\", ] series = [\"tools\"] [ author ] name = \"David Thomas\" +++You will need to fill out this header information for each new post you make. This will allow you to give your site a title, tags, date, categories, etc. This is what is called a TOML header. TOML stands for Tom’s Obvious Minimal Language. Which is a minimal language used for parsing data. Hugo uses TOML to fill out your site.\nSave your doc and exit. Next, there should be an about.md page now in your ~/Documents/hugo/Contents folder. Edit this to edit your about page for your site. You can use this Markdown Guide if you need help learning markdown language. https://www.markdownguide.org/\nServe your website locally Let’s test the website by serving it locally and accessing it at localhost:1313 in your web browser. Enter the command:\nhugo serveHugo will now be generating your website. You can view it by entering localhost:1313 in your webbrowser.\nYou can use this to test new changes before uploading them to your server. When you svae a post or page file such as your about page, hugo will automatically update the changes to this local page if the local server is running.\nPress “Ctrl + c” to stop this local server. This is only for testing and does not need to be running to make your site work.\nBuild out your public directory Okay, your website is working locally, how do we get it to your server to host it online? We are almost there. First, we will use the hugo command to build opur website in the public folder. Then, we will make a copy of our public folder on our server using rsync. I will also show you how to create an alias so you do not have to remember the rsync command every time.\nFrom your hugo site folder run:\n[davidthomas@fedora hugo]$ hugo Start building sites … hugo v0.98.0+extended linux/amd64 BuildDate=unknownNote: To insert an image into your post. Add the image to your ~/Documents/hugo/static directory. Then reference the image in your post like this: | EN -------------------+----- Pages | 30 Paginator pages | 0 Non-page files | 0 Static files | 16 Processed images | 0 Aliases | 15 Sitemaps | 1 Cleaned | 0 Total in 65 msNext, we will put your public hugo folder into /var/www/ on your server. Here is how to do that with an alias. Open ~/.bashrc.\nvim ~/.bashrcAdd the following line to the end of the file, making sure to replace the username and server name:\n# My custom aliases alias rsyncp='rsync -rtvzP ~/Documents/hugo/public/ username@myserver.com:/var/www/public'Save and exit the file. Then tell bash to update it’s source config file.\nsource ~/.bashrcNow your can run the command by just using the new alias any time. Your will need to do this every time you update your site locally.\nrsyncpSet up nginx on your server Install nginx\napt update apt upgrade apt install nginxcreate an nginx config file in /etc/nginx/sites-available/\nvim /etc/nginx/sites-available/publicYou will need to add the following to the file, update the options, then save and exit:\nserver { listen 80 ; listen [::]:80 ; server_name example.org ; root /var/www/mysite ; index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html ; location / { try_files $uri $uri/ =404 ; } }Enter your domain in “server_name” line in place of “example.org”. Also, point “root” to your new site file from earlier. (/var/www/public). Then save and exit.\nLink this site-available config file to sites-enabled to enable it. Then restart nginx:\nln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/public /etc/nginx/sites-enabled systemctl reload nginxAccess Permissions We will need to make sure nginx has permissions to your site folder so that it can access them to serve your site. Run:\nchmod 777 /var/www/publicFirewall Permissions You will need to make sure your firewall allows port 80 and 443. Vultr installs the ufw program by default. But your can install it if you used a different provider. Beware, enabling a firewalll could block you from accessing your vm, so do your research before tinkering outside of these instructions.\nufw allow 80 ufw allow 443Nginx Security We will want to hide your nginx version number on error pages. This will make your site a bit harder for hackers to find exploits. Open your Nginx config file at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and remove the “#” before “server_tokens off;”\nEnter your domain into your browser. Congrats! You now have a running website!\nUse Certbot to enable HTTPS Right now, our site uses the unencrypted http. We want it to use the encrypted version HTTPS (HTTP over SSL). This will increase user privacy, hide usernames and passwords used on your site, and you get the lock symbol by your URL name instead of “!not secure”.\nInstall Certbot and It’s Nginx Module apt install python3-certbot-nginxRun certbot certbot --nginxFill out the information, certbot asks for your emaill so it can send you a reminder when the certs need to be renewed every 3 months. You do not need to consent to giving your email to the EFF. Press 1 to select your domain. And 2 too redirect all connections to HTTPS.\nCertbot will build out some information in your site’s config file. Refresh your site. You should see your new fancy lock icon.\nSet Up a Cronjob to automatically Renew certbot certs crontab -eSelect a text editor and add this line to the end of the file. Then save and exit the file:\n0 0 1 * * certbot --nginx renewYou now have a running website. Just make new posts locally, the run “hugo” to rebuild the site. And use the rsync alias to update the folder on your server. I will soon be making tutorials on making an email address for your domain, such as david@perfectdarkmode.com on my site. I will also be adding a comments section, RSS feed, email subscription, sidebar, and more.\nFeel free to reach out with any questions if you get stuck. This is meant to be an all encompassing guide. So I want it to work.\nExtras Optimizing images Create assets folder in main directory.\nCreate images folder in /assets\nAccess image using hugo pipes\n{{ $image := resources.Get \"images/test-image.jpg\" }} \u003cimg src=\"{{ ( $image.Resize \"500x\" ).RelPermalink }}\" /\u003ehttps://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/",

    "content": "I started reading non-fiction after hitting my rock bottom. I found people to look up to and saw that they were reading and learning constantly to better themselves. This inspired me to develop a reading and self improvement habit that I have continued for more than 10 years.\nNo single book has the ability to change your life. But the things you do, good or bad, over time, compound to extraordinary changes.\nHere are some things that have stuck with me. (In no particular order)\n1. Become interested in other people. Once you start to see things from someone else’s view. You will have more empathy for other people. Connecting with others is what life is all about. You will not be successful in life or business without this.\n2. The safe route comes with a lot of risk. Go to college. Add to your 401k. Work a 9-5 until you are 65. This seems like the safer route. But there are a lot of risks in taking the normal path.\n3. Personal development is the best way to save a relationship. You can’t change other people. Start by reading non fictions books to discover solutions to your problems. Get your body in order. Your finances in check. Take control of your health. Start dressing nice around the house. Check in to life.\n4. Feeding into sexual instincts makes you crave novelty. Your animal self wants to mate with a variety of partners. When you reach sexual satisfaction, a cascade of events starts happening that turns you away from your partner. And make you crave novelty. If not a new partner, then some other stimulus to chase.\n5. Beat procrastination by just doing the thing. There is no answer to “How do I start?” or “What do I do next?”. You just need to clear the way for your brain to do it’s job. Open up your canvas and just begin.\n6. Leaning into pain will set you free. We are constantly running from pain and towards pleasure. In order to maintain homeostasis, your body will build tolerance and your pain/ pleasure set points will get all jacked up. Doing hard things is the only way to reset this balance.\n7. Just be happy. We can spend years seeking for answers, wanting and craving more, being unhappy with our situation. They day will never come when things are just right. Let go and just decide to be happy.\n8. Take ownership of EVERYTHING. There is no point of blaming others. To be a leader, you need to own everything. Even stuff that is not your fault.\n9. Your mind is very good at getting things to happen that you want to happen. Once you get out of your own way, you can accomplish great things. Do not underestimate your ability to figure things out.\n10. Train your brain to focus by doing less. Your ability to focus is greatly effected by your ability to let things go. Less is more in this case.\n11. Set your goals over 3 months instead of yearly. It’s almost impossible to plan effectively over a year. There are too many unknowns that can happen. Set shorter term goals and you will be able to plan down to the nitty-gritty details.\n12. You can train a dog to do anything without being a dick. A lot of people think you have to be mean to dogs in order to bend them to your will. Turns out, dogs will endure pain to get rewards. So not only is this ineffective, it’s downright bad for you and your dog. Have some compassion. Don’t be lazy. Do it the right way.\n13. People have lived through some shitty situations. Digging into history will give you some serious perspective. You don’t have to look far to see just how easy you have it. This perspective is essential.\n14. You are the only one your kids can depend on. They constantly test you to make sure you will never abandon them. Your child needs to know that you love them no matter what. Of course you love them but they do not always see it depending on how you act as a parent. Have compassion. You are on their team.\n15. Religion is a plague on Humanity. Belief is the most powerful force. Even more powerful than time. By default, people act according to their beliefs. And will do bad or stupid things without a second thought. We need to abandon this and be okay with not knowing.\n16. Humans treat animals very poorly. How do we have compassion for an insect or even plants in some cases? But we turn a blind eye on industries that experiment, torture, and kill animals with such great complexity? If you had a pet monkey, mouse, cow, chicken, pig, sheep, etc., you would bond with these animals and go through great lengths to make them happy and comfortable.\nIs it cognitive dissonance? Fear of finding out the truth? Compassion is the most manly thing ever.\n17. Don’t focus on what you can’t control. We spend a great deal of energy and time worrying about the future or regretting the past. Start to filter out things that you have no control over. And lean into the things you can control. You will be much happier.\n18. Do hard things to immunize yourself for when hard things happen. We live comfortable lives. But things won’t always be that way. Probably for anyone. Find something hard to do. Or give up something you enjoy. Even just for a day. And when the time comes to face adversity, you will be a little bit more prepared then if you never left your comfort zone in the first place.\n19. We may not have as much Free Will as we think. Imagine Osama Bin Laden’s son becoming anything other than what he is. When and where you were born. Who you were raised by. And life circumstances greatly impact who you are, the way you think, and how you behave. We aren’t in as much control as we think.\nBut all is not lost. Understanding this will give you compassion not just for others, but for your own shortcomings as well.\nIf you made it this far… Please consider giving me some feedback. I want to become a better writer and help others grow along with me. Feedback is invaluable for this goal.\nThanks for reading!",

You start out at a healthy balance. But before you know it. You are trapped in an addictive cycle.\nDISCLAIMER: YOU MAY NOT FEEL ANY NEGATIVES OF CAFFEINE UNTIL YEARS OF USE!!\nOr.. you may not associate the negatives that are currently happening with caffeine. This is because there is a disconnect with the immediate response to caffeine and the negatives it brings.\nHere’s how it goes:\nYou take caffeine through your medium of choice. (Some even go for the suppository… Coffee ENEMAS anyone?)\nYou think, “Caffeine is great”. Look at all your new “energy, adrenaline rush, tomato!”.\nYou wake up the next morning. Dreary and weary. Can’t get out of bed. Let’s get some of that caffeine to make you feel better.\nAnd the cycle repeats. You associate your dreary wearies with getting old. Your lack of sleep is because you just suck at sleeping. Your fits of irritability are just your personality.\nYour joint pain is your poor posture, not the fact that you no longer have the energy to maintain a good posture, because caffeine is sucking the life out of you.\nTake a look at this advertisement from 1924 mentioned in Eugene M. Schwartz’s famous book “Breakthrough Advertising”:\nWHY MEN CRACK.. .\nAn authority of international standing recently wrote;\n“You have overeaten and plugged your organs with moderate stimulants, the worst of which are not only alcohol and tobacco, but caffeine and sugar . . . “\nYou know them. Strong men. Vigorous men, robust men — men who have never had a sick day in their lives.\nThey drive. They drive themselves to the limit. They lash themselves over the limit with stimulants. They crack. Often, they crash.\nYou have seen them afterwards. Pitiful shells. The zest gone, the fire gone. Burnt-out furnaces of energy.\n“He was such a healthy-looking man “\nHe was. His health was his undoing. His constitution absorbed punishment. Otherwise he might have been warned in time.\n“For every action there is an equal and contrary reaction.” You learned the law in physics. It applies to bodies.\nFor every ounce of energy gained by stimulation, by whipping the nerves to action, an ounce of reserve strength is drained . . .\nBut repeated withdrawals exhaust any reserve.\nPhysical bankruptcy. Then the crash . . .\nIt’s time to get back to normal, to close the drafts, to bank some of the fires…\nAvoid stimulants. What is good for the boy is good for the man . . .\nBorrowed Energy Must Be Repaid!\nTwo million American families avoid caffeine by drinking Postum.\nAnd two million American families are better\noff for it. . .\nPeople knew this was a problem 100 years ago. Yet, we are all still addicted.\nCaffeine is the #1 ignored factor when it comes to health. Here is the “advice” we see over and over again in regards to taking control of your physical health:\nCut carbs.\nCut out blue light.\nDon’t eat past 6.\nDon’t eat uncooked spinach.\nEat only meat.\nStop eating unsoaked almonds.\nTake this supplement.\n80% of Americans consume some form of caffeine daily. I’ve seen mothers give their toddlers Mountain dew! Almonds are the problem? What world are we living in?\nWe are so obsessed with minor details that we miss the obvious. Seriously, anyone who is recommending putting butter in your coffee for optimal health has no clue what optimal health is.\nPeople are clueless about caffeine. Why?\nBecause it’s “Normal”.\nIt’s a problem that is hard to see before it’s too late.\n“But caffeine is not a problem for me.”\nAny amount of stimulants in your body is a problem. It’s effecting you today. If you want to feel breadth of emotions again, have unlimited energy throughout the day, have healthy joints, be able to recover fully from exercise, have the most creative thoughts you can possibly have…\nYou need to quit caffeine. Plain and simple. You are not living the life you are fully capable of.\nStudies showing caffeine is “Healthy”. Really think about it. Would you believe studies about cocaine funded by cocaine dealers or done my cocaine addicts that think cocaine gives them a positive lift?\nThere is a billion dollar industry that thrives off of you believing this nonsense. And the mildness of the drug and normalization make many people never second guess it.\nThe science is not as bleeding edge as we think. Especially when it comes to nutrition. Caffeine is not a vitamin. We need to start relying a little bit more on human intuition then studies funded by big caffeine and drug addicts.\nIs caffeine stopping us from living the lives we truly want? Here’s the #1 post on Reddit regarding caffeine:\nIt’s Not Withdrawal. Your Career Just Sucks\nI’m a software developer, about a year and a half caffeine-free. Immediately after quitting, my productivity at work plummeted. It hasn’t returned to pre-caffeine levels since.\nI have realized that this is not due to withdrawal, but rather because I cannot, as a human being, sit in front of a screen all day, toiling away at meaningless work for a soulless corporation. Caffeine played a pivotal role in hiding this reality. With caffeine, I can slog through all manner of tedium and even have fun. Without it, I feel a strong attraction to a “stop and smell the roses” mode of living. I go on long walks, look at trees, write poetry, and I don’t get jack shit done at work.\nI can breathe. My sleep is perfect. My digestion is perfect. My livelihood, however, is in jeopardy. I just wanted to put this out there, in case anyone has quit caffeine but is struggling with productivity or lack of motivation: It’s not withdrawal. You’re a spiritual creature in a cold, mechanical system, and now there’s no hiding.\nThere is something deeper going on here. Is caffeine used as a form of control? I mean, the Nazi’s gave prisoners soup, bread, and coffee for a reason right?\nCaffeine is a worker bee drug. It makes you a slave and complacent. It numbs your prefrontal cortex just like any other drug.\nThis screws with your ability to delay gratification and makes you seek out more short term rewards to numb the pain.\nI go over the pain-pleasure balance in my “Dopamine Nation” summary. So I won’t re-hash it here.\nBut the pain-pleasure balance is important to understand. Once you do. You will realize that putting anything in your body that is not food or water is making you miserable.\nCaffeine is a gateway drug. Imagine this..\nYou are anxious, on edge, irritable, depressed, have trouble sleeping. You think this is just you. You reach for alcohol or weed or Kratom or whatever to take the edge off. You were only in that state because of caffeine.\nThis scenario may not have happened to you yet. But I guarantee it has happened to millions of people who have turned towards drugs to numb the pain.\nCaffeine kills people, tips people with deadly heart disease over the edge, plays a factor in road rage car accident, cause vitamin and mineral deficiencies, cardiac arrhythmia, perpetuates drug addiction, and much more.\nIt’s poison.\nWhen are we going to wake up?",

For example, I could say that quitting caffeine should, in theory, promote healthy testosterone levels.\nThe immediate response from many would be: “There is no scientific evidence for this.” or “Actually, here is a study showing caffeine use spikes testosterone levels.”\nBut when you think of the time frame for most caffeine studies, your looking at around 1 day to no more than a few weeks. But we lack long term studies of people who have given up the bean and moved on to a healthier lifestyle.\nHere would be my general points for this argument:\nHealthy testosterone levels are a marker for health. The healthier you are, the higher your testosterone levels will be. (Without artificially increasing your levels through drugs or supplements.)\nCaffeine, lowers your overall health over time.\nWhen your body is in fight or flight mode. (Stress hormones go up) The first things to go is sexual function.\nLet’s go over each of these points one by one.\nHealthy testosterone levels are a marker for health. The healthier you are, the higher your testosterone levels will be. Think of all of the things that naturally raise your testosterone levels.\nExercise. Weight loss. Correcting vitamin deficiencies. (Selenium and Vitamin d being the most common) Getting good sleep. Gaining muscle mass. Quitting alcohol/ drugs. These are all things that make you healthier. This point seems pretty obvious so I won’t bore you with further analysis.\nCaffeine, lowers your overall health over time. DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A SCIENTIST. I RELY MOSTLY ON PURE INTUITION BASED ON MY LIFE EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF 1,000’s OF OTHERS.\nThis one seems obvious as well. You are ingesting a natural insecticide (poison) and central nervous system stimulant. One linked to stomach issues, malnutrition, insomnia, hypertension, high blood pressure, elevated cortisol, etc.\nWhen your body is in fight or flight mode. (Stress hormones go up) The first things to go is sexual function. Your adrenals are too busy pumping out cortisol and getting worn out over time to produce steroid hormones.

Anything I could get my hands on. Cocaine, ecstasy, weed, Xanax, Oxycontin, ciggys, alcohol, ativan, seroquil, spice, mushrooms.. You name it.\nDesperately wanting to avoid prison time, I did whatever I could to turn my life around. The potential pain in carrying on was too great to tolerate. This was my rock bottom.\nI enrolled in college, started working out every day, got rid of any “friends” that wanted to continue that lifestyle.\nAnd quitting my daily drug use?\nIt wasn’t a factor. I was too scared. I was willing to do anything to escape my prison sentence so I dropped them all without looking back. I was lucky. Lucky I had hit rock bottom. Lucky that everything collapsed around me. I needed a push and this was it.\nApparently the judge saw that I was making real change and I was able to avoid prison. I was slapped with a couple of felonies, fines, and drug and rehab classes.\nHaving felonies on my record was hard. I couldn’t get a decent job. Even Walmart was excited to hire me, but then rejected me because of my record. I knew that I had turned a new leaf. I just needed someone to see that I was changed now.\nLuckily, I found a family that needed help with their special needs kid.\nI worked for them for long enough to get my felonies reduced and expunged off my record.\nWhen hard drugs turn into soft drugs. I thought I was “drug free” because I had stopped all illegal drugs. But soon I found myself consuming copious amounts of caffeine in order to lose weight and get “Jacked”. You see, I found a passion for natural bodybuilding and Jiu-Jitsu around 2011.\nI consumed endless content on how to lose body fat so I could finally get a six pack. A lot of YouTubers at the time were promoting pre-workouts like Jack3d. Which also had another stimulant called 1,3 dimethylamylamine - or DMAA. Which was banned after it had become known to be problematic.\nSo there I was, taking Jack3d, working out, and trying to figure out how to get a six pack. I hired the same coaches that my favorite YouTuber Matt Ogus had. 3DMuscleJourney. I got very serious with Diet and training.\nWhen I started with 3DMuscleJourney in 2012, I had been working out for a solid year. I had gotten down to 195lbs from 215. Not a huge difference. And I had put on a good amount of Muscle in that time.\nMe at 215.\nMe at 195.\n3DMuscleJourney taught me and guided me on how to train effectively while dieting and how to diet efficiently by tracking macros. But my preworkout and caffeine use had spiked up 1,500mg a day. I used caffeine as a substitute for food. After 12 weeks, I was down to 160lbs.\nI was fit by any person’s definition. My new found glory would soon collapse as my caffeine and DMAA use caught up to me. I started having bad shoulder pain, my joints were achy and cracky, popping every time I moved. I started stretching and doing mobility exercises but the pain in my body only got worse. I was unable to sleep. I would have fits of rage followed by lows of doubt and depression.\nThen, I broke. I was no longer able to exercise because of the pain. I started eating more to see if it would help my joints. I quickly gained 30lbs. Probably within only a few weeks. I ended my coaching and started to slip back towards the abyss.\nThat’s when I figured out that caffeine and DMAA were both a huge problem.\nI had been consuming caffeine my whole life. But never thought twice about it. It was a legal substance that a kid could go buy in a vending machine. How bad could it be? Broken, I decided to quit.\nI was quickly able to cut out DMAA. But every attempt at quitting caffeine left me in so much pain that I would quickly rationalize going back to it. I never made it past two weeks.\nWhy was this harder than quitting all of those harder drugs?\nI guess decades of using a softer drug still carves out some pretty steep ravines in your reward pathway. Caffeine was my last vice. Or so I thought..\nI read the book “Caffeine Blues”. This book explained that caffeine is not healthy in any way. It is a stimulant that causes your body to break down over time just like any drug. The book outlined some of the negatives associated with caffeine.\nPoor sleep, even if you didn’t consume caffeine close to bedtime. Joint pain from increased muscle tension. Poor vitamin and mineral absorption. Energy crashes and mood swings. Irritability. Psychosis. Masking negatives of caffeine with drugs and alcohol. The list goes on. This was crazy. The book recommended tapering off of caffeine. While I was able to wean down to 300-600 most days. I couldn’t get myself to fully commit. I started to look for some help.\nMaybe I needed something to give me energy and focus while I quit?\nI started to look at “Nootropics” to help me focus. I tried a large variety of them.\nNoopept Modafinil Piracetam Aniracetam L-Theanine Phenibut Kratom Nicotine A large variety of other supplements. Non of this helped me quit caffeine. I soon realized that these legal “Performance enhancers” were just drugs. With their own highs and lows. And negative effects over time. I ended up quitting all of this after a year.\nIt was back to the drawing board.\nAround the end of 2015, I ended up doing a 3 month or so long caffeine taper. Using caffeine powder and a mg scale I bought off Amazon. The plan was slow and steady. 1-2mg per day. I didn’t want to notice my caffeine levels were dropping. After about a month under 25mg, I started feeling great.\nMy joints felt great, Arizona heat was more comfortable, I craved healthy food and exercise, I slept like a baby, the list goes on. I had raised my testosterone levels from 320ng/dL to 575ng/dL.\nBut then, just as I finally let go of caffeine. There was a surprise. A curve ball that would change my life forever.\nThe boy who lived… My first child was to be born. The 24 hours in the hospital was an introduction to the lack of sleep I would face over the next few years. I caved…\nOne or two cups of coffee later, my son was born, and a new cycle of baby wake me up \u003e being tired \u003e caffeine to get me through the day \u003e poor quality sleep \u003e baby wake me up had begun.\nI got got even more dependent on caffeine. I could no longer just take a nap whenever I wanted. I was a mess. Feeling like shit, with high stress, I also started drinking alcohol and smoking weed again. My testosterone levels plummeted down to 275ng/dL.\nGreat move dad..\nI wanted to get healthy again. I started reading books about health, nutrition, meditation, etc. I wanted to attack this problem from multiple angles. I started eating a plant-based diet, meditating, exercising, taking ice baths, etc. I quit alcohol and weed again. Tapering my caffeine down below 100mg again.\nI was starting to feel better. Even got my testosterone levels all the way up to 575ng/DL\nThe girl who lived.. Sorry about the Harry Potter references…\nJust when I thought it was over, another curve ball to my health goals. Something that would start the lack of sleep cycle all over again.\nYou guessed it.. another child! This time, there was a baby girl in my house. This new baby came with new challenges. Our daughter was born with cataracts. She had to have surgery at around 3 months old to get them removed. So not only did we have to deal with the lack of sleep stress again, and boy did she excel in that area, we had to deal with putting contacts in a baby…\nImagine a grown man squeezing their fist closed. And you have to delicately open up their fist, and place a sticky note on their palm without bending the paper. And the grown man is also having a seizure at the same time. Also, you haven’t slept a quality night of sleep for weeks.\nNeedless to say, but I’m going to say it, our stress levels shot through the roof. We had new worries and fears about our daughter’s condition and the caffeine cycle ramped back up again. All while trying to focus on my new career in IT and raising our other child.\nTestosterone Replacement Therapy I think sometime early 2023, a friend told me he was on Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). I knew my low test levels were due to stress, caffeine use, lack of sleep, belly fat, poor eating habits, etc. But I was desperate for some edge that would help me finally quit caffeine and get healthy again.\nI thought, if I can use Testosterone to help me get healthy, then I can get off of it later and not suffer any consequences.\nBoy was I wrong.\nTRT did give me more drive and gusto to get stuff done. It also made me work harder than my body wanted. I started getting more back pain from harder weightlifting session, I actually started doing more caffeine, and even weed again. I was like 6 years clean from weed at this point.\nThis made me over confident. Like I could handle anything, which led to poor decisions. I felt like a horny teenager and it made it hard to focus. I started masturbating furiously..\nAfter 4 months stabbing myself in the ass, and draining my life essence, I decided to quit TRT cold turkey. I knew this wasn’t what I needed.\nWithdrawals from TRT were bearable. I had waves of depression, lack of energy, etc. But I got through it. I’ll probably get my levels tested again soon. As I write this, I have been off of TRT for 12 months now.\nI leaned more heavily on caffeine while I was coming off of TRT. My current levels are around 400mg per day. But tapering off is my primary focus. Or maybe I should try cold turkey again? Not sure how I can afford to be a useless zombie for weeks while I have a full time job and 2 kids to look after.\n“Semen retention” and NoFap For years, I had made half ass attempts at doing No Fap and quitting porn. The benefits claimed by people who have tried it are:\nIncreased energy Vigor Willpower Can function on less sleep Increased confidence Better focus and concentration Muscle growth Increased Libido I started to read some books about the topic. This big two were “Your Brain on Porn” and “Cupid’s Poisoned Arrow”. These books took a more Science-based approach. There were also a couple books that were a little off tilt such as “Bliss of the Celibate” and “Why You Should Never Masturbate”. These books included a lot of hokey about chakras and religion.\nI never made it passed two weeks.\nAfter TRT, I decided to give it a real go. NoFap/ Semen retention felt like my final try at getting an “edge”. I lasted over a month. Just around the 3 week mark, I had felt the same benefits of TRT without all of the negatives. I also learned, that you have to be all in.\nAny sexual thoughts had to be banished. Just think of something else. If you entertain lust at all, you will fail. Stay off social media where you may run into soft porn, which can start the spiral that leads you to porn, etc.\nI was able to control my caffeine intake finally, my sleep was better, my wife was more attracted to me, I was more patient with the kids. I finally found the answer.\nBut then, I relapsed. And lost sight of the benefits. I had forgotten.\nSlowly everything started slipping again. With small nofap stints here and there never lasting more than two weeks.\nAs I write this, I am realizing that caffeine was never my problem. It was a symptom of something else. I am currently on day 6 of retention and have made it my number one priority again. I need to remember this. I need my edge back.\nThe journey continues.. Life is full of ups and downs. And decisions you make (good or bad) compound over time. I know all of the positive effort, and commitment to personal development has paid off over time. Even though it may have been slower than I had hoped.\nThis story leaves out a lot. But I’d love to have a conversation with anyone who has had similar struggles. I have been going at this alone. I can only imagine how much more growth there can be surrounding yourself with like-minded individuals.\nTa Ta for Now.",

    "content": "The cycle of caffeine addiction can be vicious. Just like any other drug.\nThe cycle goes like this:\nCaffeine causes a variety of pains and withdrawal symptoms. \u003e You use caffeine to relieve these pains and withdrawal symptoms. \u003e Caffeine causes pains and withdrawal symptoms.\nUnless you can break this pattern. You will be trapped in this cycle forever. How do you break the cycle?\nHere are 4 options for breaking the cycle. Along with the benefits and drawbacks for each.\n1. Cold turkey - dealing with the pains and withdrawal symptoms. (Suck it up!) This options requires mental toughness and discipline. If you take this path. You are fed up with caffeine and are all in on quitting. You may have had an event that pushed you over the edge. You’ve had enough.\nYou may also realize that trying to wean off may be harder because you are feeding the addiction cycle.\nYou are immediately stepping out of the cycle. This is the fastest way to quit. But many relapse when the pressure is too great to continue.\n2. Tapering - slowly lower your dose so that the cycle fades away without noticing. (Easy does it!) This option lets you continue to live a normal life. If you have to function at work or at home (or both), this may be a good option. You pick a time frame. Whether it be a few days, or 6 months. Pick an option that you think you can stick with.\nThis option may, however, lead to “serial tapering”.\nThis is where you do a good job weaning for a week or a few days or whatever. But then, due to normal life circumstances, you have a stressful day, a short deadline, a bad night of sleep, or a combo of many different things. And you default to solving this problem with caffeine.\nYour dose ends up being reset to where you started, or worse, higher.\n3. Replacing routines - finding other ways to resolve the pain. (Now we are talking!) In the book “Atomic Habits”, the author explains the cycle of cue, craving, routine, reward. The cue is the thing that triggers the craving, which leads to performing a routine, which is what gets you the reward. For caffeine, this could look like:\nCue = You are tired, but you need to get stuff done at work.\nCraving = You start to crave caffeine.\nRoutine = You take caffeine.\nReward = You feel “Energy” and get your work done.\nWith replacement theory, you replace the routine, to get the exact same reward.\nCue = You are tired, but you need to get stuff done at work.\nCraving = You crave caffeine.\nRoutine = You go on a run.\nReward = You feel “Energy” and get your work done.\nThe trick is, finding a routine to replace caffeine can be difficult. Because there are actually so many factors in the cue to begin with.\nIn my experience, a caffeine-cycle withdrawal cue looks more like this:\nCue = You have anxiety, are slightly down, have brain fog, you feel pressure to get work done, or chores, dealing with back pain, lack motivation, etc.\nCraving = You crave caffeine.\nRoutine = You take caffeine.\nReward = All of the cues, which are just a myriad of withdrawal symptoms, paired with normal life stress, are temporarily resolved.\nWhich leads me to the best option..\n4. A combination of all three (Super Saiyan!) How can you combine cold turkey AND tapering? Well, by definition you can’t. But if you merge the two, you dramatically shorten the time frame of your taper. I believe this could give you some serious momentum. Let’s break down this combo, as well as adding routine replacement:\nMeet in the middle of cold turkey and tapering to do a short, two week taper.\nFind new replacements for all of your cues.\nDuring your two week taper, write down a list of all of your cues. Then write 2-3 ideas on how to solve them.\nHere are some examples:\nCue New Routine Tired Jog, exercise, drink water Bored Pursue a new hobby or skill, read, go on a walk Feeling Down Journal, exercise, watch a inspiring video Achy Joints Stretch, mobility work, massage Anxiety Meditate, Journal, Talk to friends Hungry Drink water, Fill up with fruits and veggies, exercise Stressed Meditate, work on solving problems, support group These may be different for you. But the point is, relentless pursuit of actually solving your problems, and living a fulfilling life. Instead of masking issues with caffeine.\nI think this option is the best bang for your buck. As you are not negating the impact that withdrawal has on your life, but still dealing with any underlying problems you may face when fully caffeine free.\nNotes on the half life of caffeine. The average half life of caffeine is 5 hours. This means, if you consume 500 mg of caffeine, in 5 hours you will still have 250mg of caffeine in your system. 5 hours after that, you will have 125mg. Screw it, i’ll make a chart:\nHour Caffeine in your body (mg) 0 500 5 250 10 125 15 62.5 20 31.2 25 15.6 30 7.8 35 3.9 40 1.9 The half life of drugs can be misleading. Just because the half life is 5 hours, doesn’t mean that the drug will be clear in 10 hours. As you can see, a single dose of caffeine can technically still be in your system more than 40 hours later. And that’s just accounting for the average half life.\nThe high end can be up to 9.5 hours. This means, it can take more than 72 hours for caffeine to fully leave your system after a single dose.\nBut wait, there’s more..\nEach subsequent dose adds to the amount of caffeine in your blood system. You are likely going to start some form of mild withdrawals at the 24 hour mark. And most of us have a daily caffeine habit. This means at 24 hours, if you take another 500mg of caffeine, your new starting point is 515mg.\nIf you take caffeine daily, you ALWAYS have caffeine in your system.\nI don’t want to do anymore math, but as you can see, your caffeine levels will drop more rapidly the higher the dose. So your tapering, in theory, could get faster without feeling the same withdrawals from lowering a higher dose.\nKeep that in mind.",
