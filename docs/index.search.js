    "content": "This lab covers some basic LAN setup. Real world networks are a lot bigger than this but once you can configure these things. Troubleshooting and setting up bigger networks will be less challenging.\nHere are the settings to configure:\nVLAN setup using VTP Trunking using DTP Router on a stick Spanning Tree Etherchannel Your goal with this lab is to configure all of the settings above and verify using show commands. And test your working network with pings between all of the PCs. Finally, you will download a broken version of the lab and use your troubleshooting skills to fix it.\nThe PCs have all been configured with IP addresses and default gateways for their respective VLANs.\nPacket Tracer files for this lab\nSet up trunk ports on all switches using DTP\nYou’ll need to set up trunk ports using dtp between all of the switches. Switch1s port connecting to router1 should also be a trunk link. Then verify the trunk connections.\nEach interface you see here should be a trunk port.\nSet all used ports on switch1 to “dynamic desirable”. Later we will disable DTP and manually set up the trunk links.\nswitch1 (config) # int ra fa0/1-6\nswitch1 (config-if-range) # switchport mode dynamic desirable\nVerify trunk links on switches 3-5 leading to switch1\nYou should see trunks connecting to switch1 since dtp is set to “dynamic auto” by default on the other switches.\nswitch3 # show interfaces trunk\nRemove the dynamic desirable command\nAll of that work you did to get the trunks up using DTP? Let’s start all over and configure them manually instead.\nYou know.. just for fun.\nswitch1 (config-if) # no switchport dynamic desirable\nManually Configure Trunks\nDTP is usually disabled for security purposes. So we will configure the trunks manually.\nDesignate trunk ports with 802.1q encapsulation\nDepending on the switch, you may or may not have to do this.\nswitch3 (config-int) # switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q\nSet switch port mode to trunk\nswitch1 # interface range fa0/1-6\nswitch1 (config-if) # switchport mode trunk\nDisable dtp\nswitch1 (config-if) # switchport nonegotiate\nShow switchport info on a single interface\nswitch1 # show interfaces fa0/4 switchport\nUse VTP to Populate VLANs\nVTP is not on the current CCNA exam objectives. However, I’ve seen this in the real world so it’s good to know how it works and how to configure it.\nI’ve heard that you may see questions on the exam about VTP anyway.\nSet up VLANs on switch1\nThis lab uses VLAN 10, 20, and 30 in networks that match their respective VLAN number. With VLAN 100 being an unused VLAN for security.\nVLAN 10: 10.0.0.0 /24 VLAN 20: 20.0.0.0 /24 VLAN 30: 30.0.0.0 /24 VLAN 100: NA switch 1 (config) # vlan 10\nswitch 1 (config) # vlan 20\nswitch 1 (config) # vlan 30\nswitch 1 (config) # vlan 100\nSet switch1 to VTP mode “server”\nswitch1 (config) # vtp mode server\nSet the VTP domain name\nswitch1 (config) # vtp domain cisco\nSet the other switches to VTP “client” mode\nswitch2 (config) # vtp mode client\nConfirm VTP settings\nswitch2 # show vtp status\nConfirm VLANs are set up on all switches\nswitch2 # show vlan brief\nDisable VTP on all switches\nswitch1 (config) # vtp mode transparent\nFinal VLAN Pieces\nNow that your trunks and VLANs are configured. You can assign some ports to the VLANs. Then block the unused VLAN 100 on all of your trunk links.\nSet up access ports connected to PCs\nSet the switchport type to “access”. Then assign that access port to it’s respective VLAN.\nswitch3 (config-int) # switchport mode access\nswitch3 (config-int) # switchport access vlan 10\nRemove VLAN 100 from all trunks\nswitch1 (config-int) # switchport trunk allowed vlan remove 100\nCreate a Router on a Stick\nMake sure interface gi0/0 does not have an ip address\nrouter1 # show ip interface brief\nCreate subinterfaces on router and assign ip addresses to them\ngi0/1.10 gi0/1.20 gi0/1.30 router1 # interface gi0/1.10\nrouter1 (config-if) # ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0\nrouter1 (config-if) # encapsulation dot1q 10\nSet port on opposing switch to trunk mode\nYou’ll need to make sure the switch1 port connecting to router1 is a trunk link. This is so that all VLANs can travel to router1 for routing.\nThe PCs are already configured to use router1 as their default gateway. Assuming you configure the subinterfaces with the .1 ip address for their respective VLANS\nSpanning Tree Protocol\nThis is a very simplified Spanning Tree lab. Leave a comment if you’d like a more detailed one in the future.\nOptimize spanning tree for best path\nYou’ll want to make switch1 the root bridge for Spanning Tree. To do this, make switch1 have the lowest priority. Or manually set it as the root bridge with the “primary” command.\nThis setting should be configured for each VLAN.\nSet the priority to change the root bridge\nswitch1 (config) # spanning-tree vlan 10 priority 24,576\nChange the root bridge with the primary command\nThis will set the switches priority from 32,868 to 24,586. (24,576 + 10 for VLAN 10) The lowest priority will win the root election.\nswitch1 (config) # spanning-tree vlan 10 root primary\nView spanning tree information\nswitch1 # show spanning-tree\nView STP information on a specific VLAN\nswitch1 # show spanning-tee vlan 10\nShow summary of Spanning Tree\nswitch1 # show spanning-tree summary\nEnable PortFast on access ports for switches 3-5\nYou can set each interface manually. Or you can enable portfast on all non trunking ports with the “default” option.\nswitch3 (config-if) # spanning-tree portfast\nEnable BPDU Guard on all interfaces with PortFast\nswitch3 (config-if) # spanning-tree bpduguard enable\nEtherchannel (Layer 2)\nou’ll need to make sure that all of the Etherchannel ports are either in access mode or trunk mode. It cannot be a mix of both. Also, I had an error (twice) in Packet Tracer where the P01 interface was stuck on STP listening mode. It would not resolve until I reset Packet Tracer.\nKeep in mind when troubleshooting errors that Packet Tracer can be buggy. Your issue may be with PT software and not the IOS configuration.\nSet up an Etherchannel using PAGP\nswitch1 (config-if) # channel-group 1 mode desirable\nswitch2 (config-if) # channel-group 1 mode desirable/ auto\nSet up an Etherchannel using LACP\nswitch1 (conf-if) # channel-group 1 mode active\nswitch2 (config-if) # channel-group 1 mode active/ passive\nView Etherchannel info\nswitch1 # show etherchannel 1 port-channel\nView Etherchannel summary\nswitch1 # show etherchannel summary\nModify Etherchannel load distribution\nswitch1 # port-channel load-balance dst-ip\nShow Etherchannel load balance information\nswitch1 # show etherchannel load-balance\nPort Security\nImplement port security and add an unauthorized device.\nView port security details\nswitch3 # show port-security interface fa 0/3\nEnable port security\nSwitch ports must be not be set as dynamic. Set them manually as access ports instead.\nswitch3 (config-if-range) # switchport mode access\nswitch3 (config-if-range) # switchport port-security\nUsing the sticky command\nswitch3 (config-if-range) # switchport port-security mac-address sticky\nSet the maximum allowed mac addresses on a port to 2\nswitch3 (config-if-range) # switchport port-security maximum 2\nSet port violation to “protect”\nswitch3 (config-if-range) # switchport port-security violation protect\nSet port violation to “restrict”\nswitch3 (config-if-range) # switchport port-security violation restrict\nSet port violation to “shutdown”\nswitch3 (config-if-range) # switchport port-security violation shutdown\nSet port security to a single mac-address\nswitch3 (config-if-range) # switchport port-security mac-address aa.bb.cc.dd.ee.ff\nShutdown unused ports\nswitch3 (config-if-range) # Shutdown\nPlace unused ports into an unused vlan\nswitch3 (config-if-range) # switchport access vlan 100\nBring an interface back up from an “err-disabled” state\nThis is optional. To get a port to an err-disabled state, you’ll have to plug in an unauthorized PC if using a static mac-address. Or if you are using the maximum allowed option, plug too many PCs into a single port. Either via hub or by unplugging the PCs and plugging new ones in a few times.\nswitch3 (config-if) # shutdown\nswitch3 (config-if) # no shutdown\nShow port security Info",

Finally, the recurring keyword tells the router to spring forward an hour and fall back an hour automatically over the years.\nclock set EXEC command\nuses a time syntax with a 24-hour format, not with a 12-hour format plus a.m./p.m.).\nThe show clock command (issued seconds later) lists that time, but also notes the time as EDT, rather than UTC time.\nBasic NTP Configuration\ntwo ntp configuration commands\nntp master {stratum-level}: NTP server mode—the device acts only as an NTP server, and not as an NTP client. The device gets its time information from the internal clock on the device.\nntp server {address | hostname} : NTP client/server mode—the device acts as both client and server. First, it acts as an NTP client, to synchronize time with a server. Once synchronized, the device can then act as an NTP server, to supply time to other NTP clients.\nshow ntp status command\nlists a status of synchronized, which confirms the NTP client has completed the process of changing its time to match the server’s time. Any router acting as an NTP client will list “unsynchronized” in that first line until the NTP synchronization process completes with at least one server. It also confirms the IP address of the server—this device’s reference clock—with the IP address configured in Example 9-8 (172.16.2.2).\nshow ntp associations\nlists all the NTP servers that the local device can attempt to use, with status information about the association between the local device (client) and the various NTP servers.\nStatus on RI and R2\nClick here to view code image\nRI# show ntp associations\n!

The lower the stratum level, the more accurate the reference clock is considered to be. An NTP server that uses its internal hardware or external reference clock sets its own stratum level. Then, an NTP client adds 1 to the stratum level it learns from its NTP server, so that the stratum level increases the more hops away from the original clock source.\nFor instance, back in Figure 9-5, you can see the NTP primary server (R3) with a stratum of 2. R2, which references R3, adds 1 so it has a stratum of 3. R1 uses R2 as its NTP server, so R1 adds 1 to have a stratum of 4. These increasing stratum levels allow devices to refer to several NTP servers and then use time information from the best NTP server, best being the server with the lowest stratum level.\nRouters and switches use the default stratum level of 8 for their internal reference clock based on the default setting of 8 for the stratum level in the ntp master [stratum-level] command. The command allows you to set a value from 1 through 15; in Example 9-8, the ntp master 2 command set router R3’s stratum level to 2.\nNote\nNTP considers 15 to be the highest useful stratum level, so any devices that calculate their stratum as 16 consider the time data unusable and do not trust the time. So, avoid setting higher stratum values on the ntp master command.\nRedundant NTP Configuration an enterprise could use NTP to reference NTP servers that use an atomic clock as their reference source, like the NTP primary servers in Figure 9-6, which happen to be run by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (see tf.nist.gov).\nNTP primary server and NTP secondary server.\nAn NTP primary server acts only as a server, with a reference clock external to the device, and has a stratum level of 1, like the two NTP primary servers shown in Figure 9-6. NTP secondary servers are servers that use client/server mode as described throughout this section, relying on synchronization with some other NTP server.\nAfter losing their reference clock, R1 and R2 could no longer be useful NTP servers to the rest of the enterprise.\nTo overcome this potential issue, the routers can also be configured with the ntp master command, resulting in this logic:\nEstablish an association with the NTP servers per the ntp server command.\nEstablish an association with your internal clock using the ntp master stratum command.\nSet the stratum level of the internal clock (per the ntp master {stratum-level} command) to a higher (worse) stratum level than the Internet-based NTP servers.\nSynchronize with the best (lowest) known time source, which will be one of the Internet NTP servers in this scenario\nntp master 7 command, with a much higher stratum,\nNTP Using a Loopback Interface for Better Availability what happens when one interface on R4 fails\nfor any NTP clients that had referred to that specific IP address\nThere would likely still be a route to reach R4 itself.\nThe NTP client would not be able to send packets to the configured address because that interface is down.\nloopback interface to meet that exact need\nonce configured, it remains in an up/up state as long as\nKey Topic.\nThe router remains up.\nYou do not issue a shutdown command on that loopback interface.\nAnalyzing Topology Using CDP and LLDP Examining Information Learned by CDP Cisco-proprietary\nLayer 2 protocol\ndoes not rely on a working Layer 3 protocol\nDevices that support CDP learn information about others by listening for the advertisements sent by other devices.\nCDP discovers several useful details from the neighboring Cisco devices:\nDevice identifier: Typically the host name\nAddress list: Network and data-link addresses\nPort identifier: The interface on the remote router or switch on the other end of the link that sent the CDP advertisement\nCapabilities list: Information on what type of device it is (for example, a router or a switch)\nPlatform: The model and OS level running on the device\nCisco IP Phones use CDP to learn the data and voice VLAN IDs as configured on the access switch.\nrouters and switches support the same CDP commands, with the same parameters and same types of output.\nExample 9-15 show cdp neighbors Command Examples: SW2\nClick here to view code image\nSW2# show cdp neighbors\nCapability Codes: R\nS\nD\nRouter,\nSwitch,\nRemote,\nT\nc\nTrans\nHost,\nCVTA,\nBridge, B\nSource Route Bri\n1\nM\nIGMP, r\nRepeater, p\nTwo-port Mac Relay\nDevice ID\nSWI\nRI\nLocal Intrfce\nGig 1/0/21\nGig 1/0/2\nHoldtme\n155\n131\nCapability\nPlatform\nws-C296ex\nCili1-8P\nTotal cdp entries displayed\n.2 “\u003e To ensure all devices receive a CDP message, the Ethernet header uses a multicast destination MAC address (0100.0CCC.CCCC).\nthe device processes the message and then discards it, rather than forwarding it\nshow cdp neighbors detail\nlists the full name of the switch model (WS-2960XR-24TS-I) and the IP address configured on the neighboring device.\nThe show cdp entry name command lists the exact same details shown in the output of the show cdp neighbors detail command, but for only the one neighbor listed in the command.\nCisco recommends that CDP be disabled on any interface that might not have a need for CDP. For switches, any switch port connected to another switch, a router, or to an IP phone should use CDP.\nConfiguring and Verifying CDP IOS typically enables CDP globally and on each interface by default. You can then disable CDP per interface with the no cdp enable interface subcommand\nre-enable it with the cdp enable interface subcommand\ndisable and re-enable CDP globally on the device\nno cdp run and cdp run global commands\nsend time and the hold time. CDP sends messages every 60 seconds by default, with a hold time of 180 seconds. The hold time tells the device how long to wait after no longer hearing from a device before removing those details from the CDP tables. You can override the defaults with the cdp timer seconds and cdp holdtime seconds global commands, respectively.\nExamining Information Learned by LLDP the LLDP output in the example does differ from CDP in a few important ways:\nLLDP uses B as the capability code for switching, referring to bridge, a term for the device type that existed before switches that performed the same basic functions.\nLLDP does not identify IGMP as a capability, while CDP does (I).\nCDP lists the neighbor’s platform, a code that defines the device type, while LLDP does not.\nLLDP lists capabilities with different conventions (see upcoming Example 9-19).\nSystem Capabilities: What the device can do\nEnabled Capabilities: What the device does now with its current configuration\nLLDP uses the same messaging concepts as CDP, encapsulating messages directly in data-link headers. Devices do not forward LLDP messages so that LLDP learns only of directly connected neighbors. LLDP does use a different multicast MAC address (0180.C200.000E)\nConfiguring and Verifying LLDP Cisco devices default to disable LLDP\nLLDP separates the sending and receiving of LLDP messages as separate functions.\nLLDP support processing receives LLDP messages on an interface so that the switch or router learns about the neighboring device while not transmitting LLDP messages to the neighboring device.\nthe commands include options to toggle on|off the transmission of LLDP messages separately from the processing of received messages.\n[no] lldp run: A global configuration command that sets the default mode of LLDP operation for any interface that does not have more specific LLDP subcommands (lldp transmit, lldp receive). The lldp run global command enables LLDP in both directions on those interfaces, while no lldp run disables LLDP.\n[no] lldp transmit: An interface sub-command that defines the operation of LLDP on the interface regardless of the global [no] lldp run command. The lldp transmit interface subcommand causes the device to transmit LLDP messages, while no lldp transmit causes it to not transmit LLDP messages.\n[no] lldp receive: An interface subcommand that defines the operation of LLDP on the interface regardless of the global [no] lldp run command. The lldp receive interface subcommand causes the device to process received LLDP messages, while no lldp receive causes it to not process received LLDP messages.\nshow lldp interface lists the interfaces on which LLDP is enabled.\nlike CDP, LLDP uses a send timer and hold timer for the same purposes as CDP. The example shows the default settings of 30 seconds for the send timer and 120 seconds for the hold timer. You can override the defaults with the lldp timer seconds and lldp holdtime seconds global commands",

Most common pseudo devices are character devices.\n- /dev/zero - accepts and discards all input, produces a continuous stream of NULL (zero value) bytes.\n- /dev/null - accepts and discards all input, produces no output\n- /dev/random - produces random numbers\nPATA Devices\nSometimes in older systems you may see hard drives being referred to with an hd prefix\n/dev/hda - First hard disk\n/dev/hdd2 - Second partition on 4th hard disk\nsysfs\nA virtual filesystem, most often mounted to the /sys directory. It gives us more detailed information than what we would be able to see in the /dev directory.\nThe /dev directory is simple, it allows other programs to access devices themselves. The /sys filesystem is used to view information and manage the device.\n/sys filesystem contains all the information for all devices on your system, such as the manufacturer, model, where the device is plugged in, the state of the device, the hierarchy of devices, and more.\nYou don’t really interact with devices here, you just manage them.\nudev\nDynamically creates and removes device files depending on whether or not they are connected. There is a udev daemon that is running on the system and it listens for messages from the kernel about devices connected to the system. Udevd will parse that information and it will match the data with the rules that are specified in /etc/udev/rules.d. Depending on those rules it will most likely created device nodes and symbolic links for the devices. You can write your own udev rules. But comes with it’s on rules by default.\n$ udevadm info –query=all –name=/dev/sda\nTo view the udev database and sysfs\nlsusb, lspci, lssci\n$ lsusb\nList USB devices\n$ lspci\nList PCI devices\n$ lsscsi\nList scsi devices\ndd\nUseful tool for converting and copying data. It reads input from a file or data stream and writes it to a file or data stream.\n$ dd if=/home/pete/backup.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1024\nThis command is copying the contents of backup.img to/dev/sdb. It will copy the data in blocks of 1024 bytes until there is no more data to be copied.\n- if=file - input file, read from a file instead of standard input\n- of=file - Output file, write to a file instead of standard output\n- bs=bytes - Block size, it reads and writes this many bytes of data at a time. You can use different size metrics by denoting the size with a K for kilobyte, m for megabyte, etc, so 1024 bytes is 1k.\n- count=number - number of blocks to copy.\nSome dd commands use the count option.\nYou can use dd to backup whole disk drives, restoring disk images and more.",

This check is performed on both ARP requests and responses. When enabled, packets with different MAC addresses are classified as invalid and are dropped. For dst-mac, check the destination MAC address in the Ethernet header against the target MAC address in ARP body. This check is performed for ARP responses. When enabled, packets with different MAC addresses are classified as invalid and are dropped. For ip, check the ARP body for invalid and unexpected IP addresses.

ACL Implementation Considerations\nPlace more specific statements early in the ACL.\nDisable an ACL from its interface (using the no ip access-group interface subcommand) before making changes to the ACL.\nBy doing so, you avoid issues with the ACL during an interim state\nMitigating Security Issues with ACLs\nSecurity threats that can be mitigated with ACLs\n- IP address spoofing, inbound\n- IP address spoofing, outbound\n- DoS TCP SYN attacks, blocking external attacks\n- Dos TCP SYN attacks, using TCP Intercept\n- DoS smurf attacks\n- Denying/filtering ICMP messages, inbound\n- Denying/filtering ICCMP messages, outbound\n- Denying/filtering Traceroute\n* Don’t allow external packets that have an internal destination address.\nConfiguring ACLs from the internet\nDeny any source addresses from your internal networks - Deny any local host addresses (127.0.0.0/8)\n- Deny any reserved private addresses (RFC 1918)\n- Deny any addresses in the IP multicast address range (224.0.0.0/4)\nControlling VTY (Telnet/ SSH) Access\n1. Create a standard IP access list that permits only the host or hosts you want to be able to telnet into the routers.\n2. Apply the access list to the VTY line with the access-class in command.\n(g) # access-list 50 permit host 172.16.10.3\n(g) # line vty 0 4\n(int) # access-class 50 in\nMonitoring Access Lists\n# show access-list\nshows access lists, parameters, statistics, etc.\n# show access-list 110\nShows info for access list 110\n# show ip access-list\nshows IP access lists on the router\n# show ip interface\nShows which interfaces have access lists set on them.\n# show running-config\nShows ACLs and what interfaces that have them.",

    "content": " It took me a whopping 2 years to finish my CCNA! I kept giving up and quitting my studies for months at a time. Why? Because I couldn’t remember the massive amount of content covered in the CCNA. It felt hopeless. I could have done it in 6 month (or faster) if I knew how to study.\nI hadn’t taken a test in 10 years before this. So I had completely forgotten how to learn. This post is about the mistakes I made studying for the CCNA and how to avoid them.\nYou will also learn, as I did, about spaced repetition. I’ve also included a 6 month CCNA spaced repetition calendar.\nMy Mistakes, So You Don’t Make Them Mistake #1 Didn’t start flashcards until the final 30 days I wish I would have started flashcards from day 1. This would have helped a crap ton. Remembering all of the little details is not only useful for taking the test. It embeds the concepts in your brain and keeps you processing how things work .\nIf there is anything you take from this list. You should definitely be doing some flashcards every day.\nMistake #2 Not enough labs as I went. While studying the OCG and video courses. I did some labs. But I also skipped a ton of labs because it wasn’t convenient at the time. Then I was forced to lab every single topic in the final 30 days. A lot of cramming was done..\nMake sure to do all of the labs as you go. Make up your own labs as well. This is very important to building job worthy skills.\nMistake #3 Didn’t have a plan or stick with it. When your plan consists of, “just read everything and watch the videos and take the test when you feel ready”, you tend to procrastinate and put things off. Make a study schedule and a solid plan. (See below)\nHaving a set date for when you will take the test was pretty motivating. I did not find this out until about 30 days until my test.\nSpaced Repetition If you are using Anki flashcards for your studies, you may already be using spaced repetition. Spaced repetition is repeatedly reviewing with the time in between reviews getting longer each time you review it.\nHere is an excellent article about our learning curves and why spaced repetition helps us remember things https://fs.blog/spacing-effect/\nHow to set up a spaced repetition calendar for CCNA. Step 1. Plan how long your studies will take\nFigure out how long you need. It usually takes around 240 hours of studying for CCNA. (Depending on experience). Then figure out how many hours per day that you can spend on studying. This example is based on a 6 month study calendar.\nYou can use this 6 month excel calendar to plan and track your progress. You. can still use this method If you have already been studying CCNA. Just edit your calendar for how much time you have left.\nThe calendar is also based on Wendel Odom’s Official Cert Guide. You will also want to mix your other resources into your reviews.\nDecide what your review sessions will be\nPlan to review each chapter 3-4 times. here is what I did for review sessions to pass the exam.\nReview 1 Read and highlight (and flashcards)\nRead the chapter. Highlight key information that you want to remember. Do a lab for the material you studied (if applicable) Answer DIKTA questions Start Chapter 1 Anki Flascards Review 2 Copy highlights over to OneNote (keep doing flashcards)\nCopy your highlights over to OneNote. (using copy and paste if you have the digital book) Read your highlights and make sure you understand everything. lab and continue doing flashcards. (just go through Anki suggested flashcards, not just ones for the specific chapter.) Review 3 Labs and Highlight your notes (and flashcards)\nMore labs!\nGo over your notes. Color coding everything. (You can find my jumbled note mess here)\nGreen: Read again\nTeal: Very important Learn this/ lab it.\nRed/ purple: make extra flashcards out of this.\nReview 4 Practice questions and review\nGo through and answer the DIKTA questions again. Review any missed answers. Lab anything you aren’t quite sure of. The final 30 days\nI HIGHLY recommend Boson ExSim for your final 30 days of studying. ExSim comes with 3 exams (A,B, and C). Start with exam A in test simulation mode. Leave about a week in between each practice exam so you can go over your answers and Boson’s explanations for each answer.\nOne week before your test, (after you’ve completed exams A,B, and C). Do a random exam. Make sure you do the timed version that don’t show your score as you go.\nYou should be scoring above 900 by your 3rd and 4th exam if you have been reviewing Boson’s answer explanations.\nSchedule your exam\nPearson view didn’t let me schedule the exam past 30 days out from when I wanted to take it. I’m not sure if this is the case all the time. But by the time you are 30 days out you should have your test scheduled. This will light the fire under you. Great motivation for the home stretch.\nIf your exam is around June during Cisco Live, Cisco usually offers a 50% discount for an exam voucher. You probably won’t find any other discounts unless you pay for Cisco’s specific CCNA training.\nFinal word on labs You can technically pass the CCNA without doing many labs. But this will leave you at a HUGE disadvantage in the job market. Labs are crucial for really understanding networking. Knowing your way around the CLI and being able to troubleshoot networking issues will make you stand out from those who crammed for the exam.\nIf you’ve made it this far I really appreciate you taking the time to read this post. I really hope it helps at least one person.",

However, IANA does still reserve some IPv6 address ranges for specific purposes.\nPublic and Private IPv6 Addresses\nglobal unicast addresses as the public IPv6 address space.\nGlobal unicast: Addresses that work like public IPv4 addresses. The organization that needs IPv6 addresses asks for a registered IPv6 address block, which is assigned as a global routing prefix. After that, only that organization uses the addresses inside that block of addresses—that is, the addresses that begin with the assigned prefix.\nUnique local: Works somewhat like private IPv4 addresses, with the possibility that multiple organizations use the exact same addresses, and with no requirement for registering with any numbering authority.\nThat reserved block of IPv6 addresses—a set of addresses that only one company can use—is called a global routing prefix.\nAddress Ranges for Global Unicast Addresses\nunique local unicast addresses, discussed later in this chapter, all start with hex FD.\nany address ranges that are not specifically reserved, for now, are considered to be global unicast addresses.\nddress Type Global unicast Unique local Multicast Link local First Hex Digits 2 or 3 (originally); all not otherwise reserved (today) FE80 “\u003e\nIPv6 Subnetting Using Global Unicast Addresses\nMost everyone uses the easiest possible IPv6 prefix length: /64.\nthe right side of the IPv6, formally called the interface ID (short for interface identifier), acts like the IPv4 host field.\nthe prefix length of the global routing prefix is often between /32 and /48, or possibly as long as /56.\nwith the commonly used 64-bit interface ID field, the subnet field is typically 64–P bits, with P being the length of the global routing prefix.\nAll subnet IDs begin with the global routing prefix.\nUse a different value in the subnet field to identify each different subnet.\nAll subnet IDs have all 0s in the interface ID.\nThe IPv6 subnet ID, more formally called the subnet router anycast address, is reserved and should not be used as an IPv6 address for any host.\nAssigning Addresses to Hosts in a Subnet\nhosts can learn these same settings dynamically, using either Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or a built-in IPv6 mechanism called Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).\nUnique Local Unicast Addresses\nUnique local unicast addresses act as private IPv6 addresses.\nThe biggest difference lies in the literal number (unique local addresses begin with hex FD) and with the administrative process: the unique local prefixes are not registered with any numbering authority and can be used by multiple organizations.\nUse FD as the first two hex digits.\nChoose a unique 40-bit global ID.\nAppend the global ID to FD to create a 48-bit prefix, used as the prefix for all your addresses.\nUse the next 16 bits as a subnet field.\nNote that the structure leaves a convenient 64-bit interface ID field.\nIANA actually reserves prefix FC00::/7, and not FD00::/8, for these addresses. FC00::/7 includes all addresses that begin with hex FC and FD. However, an RFC (4193) requires the eighth bit of these addresses to be set to 1, which means that in practice today, the unique local addresses all begin with their first two digits as FD.\nSubnetting with Unique Local IPv6 Addresses\nWith unique local, you create that prefix locally, and the prefix begins with /48, with the first 8 bits set and the next 40 bits randomly chosen.\nimagine you chose a 10-hex-digit value of hex 00 0001 0001, prepend a hex FD, making the entire prefix be FD00:0001:0001::/48, or FD00:1:1::/48 when abbreviated.\nThe Need for Globally Unique Local Addresses\nRFC stresses the importance of choosing your global ID in a way to make it statistically unlikely to be used by other companies.\nin a real network, plan on using the random number generator logic listed in RFC 4193 to create your prefix.\nOne of the big reasons to attempt to use a unique prefix, rather than everyone using the same easy-to-remember prefixes, is to be ready for the day that your company merges with or buys another company.\nWith IPv6 unique local addresses, if both companies did the right thing and randomly chose a prefix, they will most likely be using completely different prefixes, making the merger much simpler",

Today, most data-link frames carry either an IPv4 packet or an IPv6 packet.\nTo route an IPv6 packet, a router must use its IPv6 routing table instead of the IPv4 routing table.\nthe process works like IPv4, except that the IPv6 packet lists IPv6 addresses, and the IPv6 routing table lists routing information for IPv6 subnets (called prefixes).\n(The migration strategy of running both IPv4 and IPv6 is called dual stack.) All you have to do is configure the router to route IPv6 packets, in addition to the existing configuration for routing IPv4 packets.\nIPv6 Routing Protocols\nRouting Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) were all updated to support IPv6.\nthese routing protocols also follow the same interior gateway protocol (IGP) and exterior gateway protocol (EGP) conventions as their IPv4 cousins. RIPng, EIGRPv6, and OSPFv3 act as interior gateway protocols, advertising IPv6 routes inside an enterprise.\nRepresenting the Prefix Length of an Address\nIPv6 uses a mask concept, called the prefix length, similar to IPv4 subnet masks.\nthe IPv6 prefix length is written as a /, followed by a decimal number. The prefix length defines how many bits of the IPv6 address define the IPv6 prefix, which is basically the same concept as the IPv4 subnet ID.\nWhen writing an IPv6 address and prefix length in documentation, you can choose to leave a space before the /, or not, as shown in the next two examples.\n2222:1111:0:1:A:B:C:D/64\n2222:1111:0:1:A:B:C:D /64\nFinding the IPv6 Prefix\nby zeroing out the last 64 bits (16 digits) of the address, you find the following prefix value:\n2000:1234:5678:9ABC:0000:0000:0000:0000/64\nThis value can be abbreviated, with four quartets of all 0s at the end, as follows:\n2000:1234:5678:9ABC::/64",

The solution takes only a single command—ipv6 unicast-routing—which enables IPv6 routing on the router.\nA router must enable IPv6 globally (ipv6 unicast-routing) and enable IPv6 on the interface (ipv6 address) before the router will attempt to route IPv6 packets in and out an interface. If you omit the ipv6 unicast-routing command but configure interface IPv6 addresses, the router will not route any received IPv6 packets, but the router will act as an IPv6 host. If you include the ipv6 unicast-routing command but omit all the interface IPv6 addresses, the router will be ready to route IPv6 packets but have no interfaces that have IPv6 enabled, effectively disabling IPv6 routing\nVerifying the IPv6 Address Configuration\nThe show ipv6 interface brief command gives you interface IPv6 address info, but not prefix length info, similar to the IPv4 show ip interface brief command.\nthis command lists IPv6 addresses, but not the prefix length or prefixes.\nThe show ipv6 interface command gives the details of IPv6 interface settings, much like the show ip interface command does for IPv4.\nthe show interfaces command still lists the IPv4 address and mask but tells us nothing about IPv6.

For example, IOS converts ipv6 address 2000:1:1:1::1/64 eui-64 to ipv6 address 2000:1:1:1::/64 eui-64.\nDynamic Unicast Address Configuration\nrouters can be configured to use dynamically learned IPv6 addresses.

Note that the configured link-local address must be from the correct address range for link-local addresses; that is, an address from prefix FE80::/10. In other words, the address must begin with FE8, FE9, FEA, or FEB.\nIf not configured, the IOS calculates the link-local address using EUI-64 rules, as discussed and demonstrated in and around Example 24-7. The calculation uses EUI-64 rules even if the interface unicast address does not use EUI-64.\nRouting IPv6 with Only Link-Local Addresses on an Interface\nipv6 address address/prefix-length: Static configuration of a specific address\nipv6 address prefix/prefix-length eui-64: Static configuration of a specific prefix and prefix length, with the router calculating the interface ID using EUI-64 rules\nipv6 address dhcp: Dynamic learning on the address and prefix length using DHCP\nipv6 address autoconfig: Dynamic learning of the prefix and prefix length, with the router calculating the interface ID using EUI-64 rules (SLAAC)\nipv6 enable: Enables IPv6 processing and adds a link-local address, but adds no other unicast IPv6 addresses.\nsome links, particularly WAN links, do not need a global unicast address\nthe routers do not need to have global unicast (or unique local) addresses on the WAN links for routing to work. IPv6 routing protocols use link-local addresses as the next-hop address when dynamically building IPv6 routes.\nstatic routes, as discussed in Chapter 25, “Implementing IPv6 Routing,” can use link-local addresses for the next-hop address.\ncreating a WAN link with no global unicast (or unique local) addresses works. As a result, you would not even need to assign an IPv6 subnet to each WAN link. Then to configure the WAN interfaces, use the ipv6 enable command, enabling IPv6 and giving each interface a generated link-local IPv6 address.\nTo use the command, just configure the ipv6 enable command on the interfaces on both ends of the WAN link.\nIPv6 Multicast Addresses\nIANA defines the range FF30::/12 (all IPv6 addresses that begin with FF3) as the range of addresses to be used for some types of multicast applications.\ndifferent IPv6 RFCs reserve multicast addresses for specific purposes. For instance, OSPFv3 uses FF02::5 and FF02::6 as the all-OSPF-routers and all-DR-Routers multicast addresses,\nOSPFv2 uses IPv4 addresses 224.0.0.5 and 224.0.0.6 for the equivalent purposes.\nReserved Multicast Addresses\nIPv6, instead of using Layer 3 and Layer 2 broadcasts, instead uses Layer 3 multicast addresses, which in turn cause Ethernet frames to use Ethernet multicast addresses. As a result:\nAll the hosts that should receive the message receive the message, which is necessary for the protocols to work. However…\n…Hosts that do not need to process the message can make that choice with much less processing as compared to IPv4.\nOSPFv3 uses IPv6 multicast addresses FF02::5 and FF02::6. In a subnet, the OSPFv3 routers will listen for packets sent to those addresses. However, all the endpoint hosts do not use OSPFv3 and should ignore those OSPFv3 messages\nthe most common reserved IPv6 multicast addresses.\nll-nodes All-routers All-OSPF, All- OSPF-DR RIPng Routers EIGRPv6 Routers DHCP Relay Agent Multicast Address Meaning All-nodes (all interfaces that use IPv6 that are on the link) All-routers (all IPv6 router interfaces on the link) All OSPF routers and all OSPF-designated routers, respectively All RIPng routers All routers using EIGRP for IPv6 (EIGRPv6) All routers acting as a DHCPv6 relay agent IPv4 Equivalent 224.0.0.1 224.0.0.2 224.0.0.5, 224.0.0.6 224.0.0.9 224.0.0.10 None “\u003e\nshow ipv6 interface command to show the multicast addresses used by Router R1 on its G0/0 interface.\nlick here to view code image RI* show ipv6 interface GigabitEthernet 0/0 GigabitEthernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is FE80: : 1 No Virtual link-local address(es): Global 2ee1.

In the future, when any router receives a packet for that anycast address, the other routers simply route the packet to the nearest router that supports the address.\nthe routers implementing the anycast address must be configured and then advertise a route for the anycast address.

Check for these types of mistakes:\nStep 1. Prefix/Length: Does the ipv6 route command reference the correct subnet ID (prefix) and mask (prefix length)?\nStep 2. If using a next-hop IPv6 address that is a link-local address:\nA. Is the link-local address an address on the correct neighboring router? (It should be an address on another router on a shared link.)\nB. Does the ipv6 route command also refer to the correct outgoing interface on the local router?\nStep 3. If using a next-hop IPv6 address that is a global unicast or unique local address, is the address the correct unicast address of the neighboring router?\nStep 4. If referencing an outgoing interface, does the ipv6 route command reference the interface on the local router (that is, the same router where the static route is configured)?\nThe Static Route Does Not Appear in the IPv6 Routing Table\nIOS makes the following checks before adding the route;\nFor ipv6 route commands that list an outgoing interface, that interface must be in an up/up state.\nFor ipv6 route commands that list a global unicast or unique local next-hop IP address (that is, not a link-local address), the local router must have a route to reach that next-hop address.\nIf another IPv6 route exists for that exact same prefix/prefix-length, the static route must have a better (lower) administrative distance.\nThe Neighbor Discovery Protocol\nwith 1pv4 ARP works as a separate protocol; with IPv6, the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), a part of ICMPv6, performs the same functions.\nfew of the functions of the NDP protocol (RFC 4861). Some of those NDP functions are\nNeighbor MAC Discovery: An IPv6 LAN-based host will need to learn the MAC address of other hosts in the same subnet. NDP replaces IPv4’s ARP, providing messages that replace the ARP Request and Reply messages.\nRouter Discovery: Hosts learn the IPv6 addresses of the available IPv6 routers in the same subnet.\nSLAAC: When using Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC), the host uses NDP messages to learn the subnet (prefix) used on the link plus the prefix length.\nDAD: Before using an IPv6 address, hosts use NDP to perform a Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) process, to ensure no other host uses the same IPv6 address before attempting to use it.\nDiscovering Neighbor Link Addresses with NDP NS and NA\nusing a pair of matched solicitation and advertisement messages: the Neighbor Solicitation (NS) and Neighbor Advertisement (NA) messages.\nthe NS acts like an IPv4 ARP request, asking the host with a particular unicast IPv6 address to send back a reply. The NA message acts like an IPv4 ARP Reply, listing that host’s MAC address.\nNeighbor Solicitation (NS): This message asks the host with a particular IPv6 address (the target address) to reply with an NA message that lists its MAC address. The NS message is sent to the solicited-node multicast address associated with the target address, so the message is processed only by hosts whose last six hex digits match the address that is being queried.\nNeighbor Advertisement (NA): This message lists the sender’s IPv6 and MAC addresses. It can be sent in reply to an NS message, and if so, the packet is sent to the IPv6 unicast address of the host that sent the original NS message. A host can also send an unsolicited NA, announcing its IPv6 and MAC addresses, in which case the message is sent to the all-IPv6-hosts local-scope multicast address FF02::1.\nNS PC2 MAC I am MAC Figure 25-8 Example NDP NS/NA Process to Find the Neighbor’s Link Addresses “\u003e\nlick here to view code image R3# show ipv6 neighbors IPv6 Address FE8Ø: Age e e Link-layer Addr 0201. ame. oeel 0201. ame. oeel State REACH REACH “\u003e\nTo view a host’s NDP neighbor table, use these commands: (Windows) netsh interface ipv6 show neighbors; (Linux) ip -6 neighbor show; (Mac OS) ndp -an.\nDiscovering Routers with NDP RS and RA\nNDP defines two messages that allow any host to discover all routers in the subnet:\nRouter Solicitation (RS): This message is sent to the “all-IPv6-routers” local-scope multicast address of FF02::2 so that the message asks all routers, on the local link only, to identify themselves.\nRouter Advertisement (RA): This message, sent by the router, lists many facts, including the link-local IPv6 address of the router. When sent in response to an RS message, it flows back to either the unicast address of the host that sent the RS or to the all-IPv6-hosts address FF02::1. Routers also send RA messages without being asked, sent to the all-IPv6-hosts local-scope multicast address of FF02::1.\nLink-Local) RS All Routers—identify Yourselves I Am: 3: Figure 25-9 Example NDP RS/RA Process to Find the Default Routers RI 2 “\u003e\nIPv6 allows multiple prefixes and multiple default routers to be listed in the RA message; Figure 25-9 just shows one of each for simplicity’s sake.\nalso periodically send unsolicited RA messages\nthe RA messages flow to the FF02::1 all-nodes IPv6 multicast address.\nUsing SLAAC with NDP RS and RA\nIPv6 supports an alternative method for IPv6 hosts to dynamically choose an unused IPv6 address to use\nThe process goes by the name Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).\nLearn the IPv6 prefix used on the link, from any router, using NDP RS/RA messages.\nBuild an address from the prefix plus an interface ID, chosen either by using EUI-64 rules or as a random value.\nBefore using the address, first use DAD to make sure that no other host is already using the same address.\nrefix Figure 25-10 Host IPv6 Address Formation Using SLA4C Chosen by Host Interface ID E UI-64 “\u003e\nDiscovering Duplicate Addresses Using NDP NS and NA\nIPv6 uses the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) process before using a unicast address to make sure that no other node on that link is already using the address. Hosts use DAD not only at the end of the SLAAC process, but also any time that a host interface initializes, no matter whether using SLAAC, DHCP, or static address configuration. When performing DAD, if another host already uses that address, the first host simply does not use the address until the problem is resolved.\na host sends an NS message for its own IPv6 address. No other host should be using that address, so no other host should send an NDP NA in reply. However, if another host already uses that address, that host will reply with an NA, identifying a duplicate use of the address.\nHosts do the DAD check for each of their unicast addresses, link-local addresses included, both when the address is first used and each time the host’s interface comes up.\nNDP Summary\nNDP does more than what is listed in this chapter, and the protocol allows for addition of other functions, so NDP might continue to grow over time. For now, use Table 25-3 as a study reference for the four NDP features discussed here.\nunction Router discovery Prefix/length discovery Neighbor discovery Duplicate Ad- dress Detection tocol sages RS and RS and NS and NS and Who Discov- ers Info Any IPv6 host Any IPv6 host Any IPv6 host Any IPv6 host Supplies Info Any IPv6 router Any IPv6 router Any IPv6 host Any IPv6 host Info Supplied Link-local IPv6 ad- dress of router Prefix(es) and associ- ated prefix lengths used on local link Link-layer address (for example, MAC address) used by a neighbor Simple confirmation whether a unicast ad- dress is already in use “\u003e",

That power budget can then be processed to determine the amount of PoE power to make available through each switch.\nSwitch Ports: Some switches support PoE standards on all ports, some on no ports, some on a subset of ports. Research the various switch models so that you purchase enough PoE-capable ports for the switches planned for each wiring closet.\nSwitch Power Supplies: Without PoE, when purchasing a switch, you choose a power supply so that it delivers enough power to power the switch itself. With PoE, the switch acts as a distributor of electrical power, so the switch power supply must deliver many more watts than it needs to run the switch itself. You will need to create a power budget per switch, based on the number of connected PDs, and purchase power supplies to match those requirements.\nPoE Standards versus Actual: Consider the number of PoE switch ports needed, the standards they support, the standards supported by the PDs, and how much power they consume. For instance, a PD and a switch port may both support PoE+, which supports up to 30 watts supplied by the PSE. However, that powered device may need at most 9 watts to operate, so your power budget needs to reserve less power than the maximum for those devices.\nshow power inline\npower inline never\npower inline auto",

Mac Table instability Broadcast storm is causing broadcast packets going in and out of every port, the Switch has to keep updating the source mac address of those packets. Multiple frame transmission Issues can be cause when multiples of the same frame are received on a port.\nSpanning tree must build a topology so it can figure out if there is a loop in the network, and pick which port(s) to block to stop any network loops.\nSpanning tree controls all ports in the network and puts them in different port “states”. These states help spanning tree learn the network topology and decide which ports to forward or block. This process is called convergence. Convergence happens whenever spanning tree realizes that there has been a change in the network. (a new switch is added or a link goes down.)The port states are Blocking, Listening, Learning, Forwarding and Disabled.\nBlocking\n• Stable state\n• Mac addresses are not learned on this port\n• Port does not forward any fram\nListening\n• Removes old or “stale” mac address entries from this port if no frames are recieved for that mac address while it is in this state.\n• Transitory state that is temporary while spanning tree converges.\n• A port in this state does not forward any frames.\n• Incoming frames mac addresses are not learned.\nLearning\n• Incoming mac addresses on this port are now learned.\n• A port in this state does not forward any frames.\n• Also a port in a transitory state.\nDisabled\n• Stable\n• Mac addresses are not learned on this port\n• Port does not forward any frames\nHow spanning tree decides.\nTo build out the topology, spanning tree elects designated ports and root ports and determines the lowest cost path to the root bridge. (root cost)\nCost is based on the operating speed of the link. Here are the cost values STP uses based on the speed of the link.\nThese are the cisco defaults:\n10 Mbps = 100\n100 Mbps = 19\n1 gbps = 4\n10 gbps = 2\n100 gbps = N/A\n1 tbps = N/A\nYou can change the values to a newer form with:\n# spanning-tree pathcost method long\nWhich changes the values to:\n10 Mbps = 2,000,000\n100 Mbps = 200,000\n1 gbps = 20,000\n10 gbps = 2,000\n100 gbps = 200\n1 tbps = 20\nDesignated ports and root ports\nSpanning tree sends Hello BPDUs to determine the spanning tree topology. A port that sends forwards hello bpdus is called a designated port. A port that receives hello bpdus is called a designated port.\nHello BPDU\nHello bpdu contains a switches Bridge ID, the root bridge ID, the senders root cost. (cost to the root bridge), and the root switches timer values.\nBridge ID (BID)\nHas an 8 byte value that is different on each switch. A 2-byte priority field. And a 6 byte system ID that is based on the mac address\nRoot Bridge ID\nThe Bridge ID of the switch that the sender thinks is currently the root switch.\nRoot Switches Timer Values\nHello Timer = How often Hello bpdus are sent\nMaxAge Timer = The max time that spanning tree will wait not getting a hello bpdu before it reconverges the network.\nForward Delay Timer = How long a port stays in the listening and learning states.\nRoot Cost\nThe cost between the sender and the root bridge\nSpanning tree elects a root bridge then decides the best path to the root bridge from all of the other switches. If there are multiple paths to the root bridge, then the worst path is blocked.

Global: Means global as in the global Internet. It is the address used for that host while the packet flows in the Internet. Alternative: Think of it as inside public, because the address is typically a public IPv4 address. “\u003e\nglobal Outside local 170.1.1.1 With source NAT, the one address used by the host that resides outside the enterprise, which NAT does not change, so there is no need for a contrasting term. Alternative: Think of it as outside public, because the address is typically a public IPv4 address. This term is not used with source NAT. With desti- nation NAT, the address would represent a host that resides outside the enterprise, but the address used to represent that host as packets pass through the local enterprise. “\u003e\nDynamic NAT Dynamic NAT sets up a pool of possible inside global addresses and defines matching criteria to determine which inside local IP addresses should be translated with NAT.\n10.1.1.1 Outside Internet NAT 10.1.1.2 NAT Table Before First Packet Server 170.1.1.1 Criteria for NAT: 10.1.1. Inside Local _lnside Global NAT Table After First Packet Inside Local 10.1.1 Inside Global 200.1.1.1 NAT Pool: 200.1.1.1 200.1.1.2 200.1.1.3 200.1.1.4 200.1.1.5 Figure 10-5 Dynamic NAT “\u003e\nHost 10.1.1.1 sends its first packet to the server at 170.1.1.1.\nAs the packet enters the NAT router, the router applies some matching logic to decide whether the packet should have NAT applied. Because the logic has been configured to match source IP addresses that begin with 10.1.1, the router adds an entry in the NAT table for 10.1.1.1 as an inside local address.\nThe NAT router needs to allocate an IP address from the pool of valid inside global addresses. It picks the first one available (200.1.1.1, in this case) and adds it to the NAT table to complete the entry.\nThe NAT router translates the source IP address and forwards the packet.\nThe dynamic entry stays in the table as long as traffic flows occasionally. You can configure a timeout value that defines how long the router should wait, having not translated any packets with that address, before removing the dynamic entry. You can also manually clear the dynamic entries from the table using the clear ip nat translation * command.\nNAT can be configured with more IP addresses in the inside local address list than in the inside global address pool.\nIf a new packet arrives from yet another inside host, and it needs a NAT entry, but all the pooled IP addresses are in use, the router simply discards the packet. The user must try again until a NAT entry times out, at which point the NAT function works for the next host that sends a packet. Essentially, the inside global pool of addresses needs to be as large as the maximum number of concurrent hosts that need to use the Internet at the same time—unless you use PAT, as is explained in the next section.\nOverloading NAT with Port Address Translation NAT Overload feature, also called Port Address Translation (PAT)\n170.1.1.1 Port 80 10.1.1.2 10.1.1.3 10.1.1 1, Port49724 10.1.1.2, port 49724 10.1.1.3, Port 49733 170111 170111 port 80 Port 80 Server 170.1.1.1 Figure 10-6 Three TCP Connectionsfrom Three PCs “\u003e\n10.1.1.1 170.1.1 1 Port80 10.1.1.2 10.1.1 2 10.1 .1 .3 10.1.1.3 170.1.1 1 Port 80 Port 49724 port 49724 Port 49733 NAT 200.1.1.2 Port 49724 200.1.1.2, Port 49725 200.1.1.2 Port 49726 170.1.1.1 Port 80 Server 170.1.1.1 Inside Local 10.1.1.1: 49724 10.1.12: 49724 10.1.1.3: 49733 Inside Global 200.1.1 .2: 49724 200.1.12: 49725 200.1.1 .2: 49726 Dynamic NAT Table, With Overloading Figure 10-8 NAT Overload (PAT) “\u003e\nThe NAT router keeps a NAT table entry for every unique combination of inside local IP address and port, with translation to the inside global address and a unique port number associated with the inside global address.\nNAT overload can use more than 65,000 port numbers\nPAT is by far the most popular option\nNAT Configuration and Troubleshooting Static NAT Configuration Each static mapping between a local (private) address and a global (public) address must be configured.\nThose same interface subcommands tell NAT whether the interface is inside or outside.\nStep 1.

The static keyword means that the parameters define a static entry, which should never be removed from the NAT table because of timeout. Because the design calls for two hosts—10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2—to have Internet access, two ip nat inside commands are needed.\nshow ip nat translations command lists the two static NAT entries created in the configuration. The show ip nat statistics command lists statistics, listing things such as the number of currently active translation table entries. The statistics also include the number of hits, which increments for every packet for which NAT must translate addresses.\nDynamic NAT Configuration Dynamic NAT still requires that each interface be identified as either an inside or outside interface\nDynamic NAT uses an access control list (ACL) to identify which inside local (private) IP addresses need to have their addresses translated, and it defines a pool of registered public IP addresses to allocate.\nStep 1. Use the ip nat inside command in interface configuration mode to configure interfaces to be in the inside part of the NAT design (just like with static NAT).\nStep 2. Use the ip nat outside command in interface configuration mode to configure interfaces to be in the outside part of the NAT design (just like with static NAT).\nStep 3.

This process includes the exchange and analysis of routing information. Each router chooses the best route to each subnet (path selection) and finally places those best routes in its IP routing table. Examples include RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, and BGP.\nRouted protocol and routable protocol: Both terms refer to a protocol that defines a packet structure and logical addressing, allowing routers to forward or route the packets. Routers forward packets defined by routed and routable protocols. Examples include IP Version 4 (IPv4) and IP Version 6 (IPv6).\npath selection sometimes refers to part of the job of a routing protocol, in which the routing protocol chooses the best route.\nRouting Protocol Functions\nLearn routing information about IP subnets from neighboring routers.\nAdvertise routing information about IP subnets to neighboring routers.\nIf more than one possible route exists to reach one subnet, pick the best route based on a metric.\nIf the network topology changes—for example, a link fails—react by advertising that some routes have failed and pick a new currently best route. (This process is called convergence.)\nInterior and Exterior Routing Protocols\nIP routing protocols fall into one of two major categories: interior gateway protocols (IGP) or exterior gateway protocols (EGP).\nIGP: A routing protocol that was designed and intended for use inside a single autonomous system (AS)\nEGP: A routing protocol that was designed and intended for use between different autonomous systems\nAn AS is a network under the administrative control of a single organization.\nrouting protocols designed to exchange routes between routers in different autonomous systems are called EGPs. Today, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the only EGP used.\nIGP Routing Protocol Algorithms\nDistance vector (sometimes called Bellman-Ford after its creators)\nAdvanced distance vector (sometimes called “balanced hybrid”)\nLink-state (OSPF)\nRouting Information Protocol (RIP) was the first popularly used IP distance vector protocol, with the Cisco-proprietary Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) being introduced a little later.\nproprietary routing protocol called Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)\nit used more distance vector features than link-state, so it is more commonly classified as an advanced distance vector protocol.\nMetrics\nRouting protocols choose the best route to reach a subnet by choosing the route with the lowest metric\nRIP uses a counter of the number of routers (hops) between a router and the destination subnet\nOSPF totals the cost associated with each interface in the end-to-end route, with the cost based on link bandwidth\nThe bandwidth interface subcommand does not change the actual physical speed of the interface. It just tells IOS what speed to assume the interface is using.)\nOther IGP Comparisons\nClassless routing protocols support variable-length subnet masks (VLSM) as well as manual route summarization (supernetting) by sending routing protocol messages that include the subnet masks in the message. The older RIPv1 and IGRP routing protocols—both classful routing protocols—do not.\nAdministrative Distance\nIf one company uses OSPF and the other uses EIGRP on at least one router, both OSPF and EIGRP must be used. Then that router can take routes learned by OSPF and advertise them into EIGRP, and vice versa, through a process called route redistribution.\nWhen a single routing protocol learns multiple routes to the same subnet, the metric tells it which route is best. However, when two different routing protocols learn routes to the same subnet, because each routing protocol’s metric is based on different information, IOS cannot compare the metrics\nWhen IOS must choose between routes learned using different routing protocols, IOS uses a concept called administrative distance. Administrative distance is a number that denotes how believable an entire routing protocol is on a single router. The lower the number, the better, or more believable, the routing protocol. For example, RIP has a default administrative distance of 120, OSPF uses a default of 110, and EIGRP defaults to 90. When using OSPF and EIGRP, the router will believe the EIGRP route instead of the OSPF route (at least by default). The administrative distance values are configured on a single router and are not exchanged with other routers\nThe show ip route command lists each route’s administrative distance as the first of the two numbers inside the brackets. The second number in brackets is the metric\nIOS can be configured to change the administrative distance of a particular routing protocol, a particular route, or even a static route.\nFor example, the command ip route 10.1.3.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.130.253 defines a static route with a default administrative distance of 1, but the command ip route 10.1.3.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.130.253 210 defines the same static route with an administrative distance of 210\nTopology Information and LSAs\nEach LSA is a data structure with some specific information about the network topology; the LSDB is simply the collection of all the LSAs known to a router.\nbefore sending an LSA to yet another neighbor, routers communicate, asking “Do you already have this LSA?,” and then sending the LSA to the next neighbor only if the neighbor has not yet learned about the LSA.\nRouters reflood an LSA when some information changes (for example, when a link goes up or comes down). They also reflood each LSA based on each LSA’s separate aging timer (default 30 minutes).\nApplying Dijkstra SPF Math to Find the Best Routes\nBecoming neighbors: A relationship between two routers that connect to the same data link, created so that the neighboring routers have a means to exchange their LSDBs.\nExchanging databases: The process of sending LSAs to neighbors so that all routers learn the same LSAs.\nAdding the best routes: The process of each router independently running SPF, on their local copy of the LSDB, calculating the best routes, and adding those to the IPv4 routing table.\nThe Basics of OSPF Neighbors\nOSPF neighbors are routers that both use OSPF and both sit on the same data link. Two routers can become OSPF neighbors if connected to the same VLAN, or same serial link, or same Ethernet WAN link.\nthey must send OSPF messages and agree to become OSPF neighbors. To do so, the routers send OSPF Hello messages, introducing themselves to the potential neighbor. Assuming the two potential neighbors have compatible OSPF parameters, the two form an OSPF neighbor relationship, and would be displayed in the output of the show ip ospf neighbor command.\nallows new routers to be dynamically discovered. That means new routers can be added to a network without requiring every router to be reconfigured. Instead, OSPF routers listen for OSPF Hello messages from new routers and react to those messages, attempting to become neighbors and exchange LSDBs.\nMeeting Neighbors and Learning Their Router ID\nprocess starts with messages called OSPF Hello messages. The Hellos in turn list each router’s router ID (RID), which serves as each router’s unique name or identifier for OSPF. Finally, OSPF does several checks of the information in the Hello messages to ensure that the two routers should become neighbors.\nOSPF RIDs are 32-bit numbers.\nBy default, IOS chooses one of the router’s interface IPv4 addresses to use as its OSPF RID. However, the OSPF RID can be directly configured\nAs soon as a router has chosen its OSPF RID and some interfaces come up, the router is ready to meet its OSPF neighbors. OSPF routers can become neighbors if they are connected to the same subnet. To discover other OSPF-speaking routers, a router sends multicast OSPF Hello packets to each interface and hopes to receive OSPF Hello packets from other routers connected to those interfaces.\nThey continue to send Hellos at a regular interval based on their Hello timer settings. The Hello messages themselves have the following features:\nThe Hello message follows the IP packet header, with IP protocol type 89.\nHello packets are sent to multicast IP address 224.0.0.5, a multicast IP address intended for all OSPF-speaking routers.\nOSPF routers listen for packets sent to IP multicast address 224.0.0.5, in part hoping to receive Hello packets and learn about new neighbors.\nEach router keeps an OSPF state variable for how it views the neighbor.\nHello. This message tells R1 that R2 exists, and it allows R1 to move through the init state and quickly to a 2-way state.\nThe 2-way state is a particularly important OSPF state. At that point, the following major facts are true:\n2-way means that the router is available to exchange its LSDB with the neighbor. In other words, it is ready to begin a 2-way exchange of the LSDB.\nFirst, they tell each other a list of LSAs in their respective databases—not all the details of the LSAs, just a list. (Think of these lists as checklists.) Then each router can check which LSAs it already has and then ask the other router for only the LSAs that are not known yet.\nthe OSPF messages that actually send the LSAs between neighbors are called Link-State Update (LSU) packets. That is, the LSU packet holds data structures called link-state advertisements (LSA). The LSAs are not packets, but rather data structures that sit inside the LSDB and describe the topology.\nMaintaining Neighbors and the LSDB\nFirst, routers monitor each neighbor relationship using Hello messages and two related timers: the Hello Interval and the Dead Interval. Routers send Hellos every Hello Interval to each neighbor. Each router expects to receive a Hello from each neighbor based on the Hello Interval, so if a neighbor is silent for the length of the Dead Interval (by default, four times as long as the Hello Interval), the loss of Hellos means that the neighbor has failed.\nNext, routers must react when the topology changes as well,\nEach router’s LSDB now reflects the fact that the original router’s G0/0 interface failed, so each router will then use SPF to recalculate any routes affected by the failed interface.\nA third maintenance task done by neighbors is to reflood each LSA occasionally, even when the network is completely stable. By default, each router that creates an LSA also has the responsibility to reflood the LSA every 30 minutes (the default), even if no changes occur. (Note that each LSA has a separate timer, based on when the LSA was created, so there is no single big event where the network is overloaded with flooding LSAs.)\nUsing Designated Routers on Ethernet Links\nOn Ethernet links, OSPF defaults to use a network type of broadcast, which causes OSPF to elect one of the routers on the same subnet to act as the designated router (DR).\nThese five OSPF routers elect one router to act as the DR and one router to be a backup DR (BDR).\nThe database exchange process on an Ethernet link does not happen between every pair of routers on the same VLAN/subnet. Instead, it happens between the DR and each of the other routers, with the DR making sure that all the other routers get a copy of each LSA.\nThe BDR watches the status of the DR and takes over for the DR if it fails. (When the DR fails, the BDR takes over, and then a new BDR is elected.)\nThe DR can send a packet to all OSPF routers in the subnet by using multicast IP address 224.0.0.5\nThe DR can send one set of messages to all the OSPF routers rather than sending one message to each router.\nany OSPF router needing to send a message to the DR and also to the BDR (so it remains ready to take over for the DR) can send those messages to the “All SPF DRs” multicast address 224.0.0.6.\nrouters that are neither a DR nor a BDR—called DROthers by OSPF—never reach a full state because they do not exchange LSDBs directly with each other.\nfull state (called fully adjacent neighbors\n2-way state (called neighbors)\nall OSPF routers on the same link that reach the 2-way state—that is, they send Hello messages and the parameters match—are called neighbors. The subset of neighbors for which the neighbor relationship continues on and reaches the full state are called adjacent neighbors.\nOSPF Areas and LSAs\nA larger topology database requires more memory on each router.\nThe SPF algorithm requires processing power that grows exponentially compared to the size of the topology database.\nA single interface status change anywhere in the internetwork (up to down, or down to up) forces every router to run SPF again!\nOSPF Areas\nPut all interfaces connected to the same subnet inside the same area.\nAn area should be contiguous.\nSome routers may be internal to an area, with all interfaces assigned to that single area.\nSome routers may be Area Border Routers (ABR) because some interfaces connect to the backbone area, and some connect to nonbackbone areas.\nAll nonbackbone areas must have a path to reach the backbone area (area 0) by having at least one ABR connected to both the backbone area and the nonbackbone area.\nHow Areas Reduce SPF Calculation Time\nRouters require fewer CPU cycles to process the smaller per-area LSDB with the SPF algorithm, reducing CPU overhead and improving convergence time.\nThe smaller per-area LSDB requires less memory.\nChanges in the network (for example, links failing and recovering) require SPF calculations only on routers in the area where the link changed state, reducing the number of routers that must rerun SPF.\nLess information must be advertised between areas, reducing the bandwidth required to send LSAs.\n(OSPFv2) Link-State Advertisements\nOne router LSA for each router in the area\nOne network LSA for each network that has a DR plus one neighbor of the DR\nOne summary LSA for each subnet ID that exists in a different area Router LSAs Build Most of the Intra-Area Topology\nRouter LSAs, also known as Type 1 LSAs, describe the router in detail. Each lists a router’s RID, its interfaces, its IPv4 addresses and masks, its interface state, and notes about what neighbors the router knows about via each of its interfaces.",

So, if OSPF comes up, and later the configuration changes in a way that would impact the OSPF RID, OSPF does not change the RID immediately. Instead, IOS waits until the next time the OSPF process is restarted.\nOSPF Interface Configuration Example\nStep 1. Use the no network network-id area area-id subcommands in OSPF configuration mode to remove the network commands.\nStep 2.

As a result of these rules, while you can configure a router to be the best (highest priority) router to become the DR in an election, doing so only increases that router’s statistical chances of being the DR at a given point in time. If the router fails, other routers will become DR and BDR, and the best router will not be DR again until the current DR and BDR fail.\nThe highest OSPF interface priority: The highest value wins during an election, with values ranging from 0 to 255.\nThe highest OSPF Router ID: If the priority ties, the election chooses the router with the highest OSPF RID.\nIf an engineer preferred that R1 be the DR, the engineer could add the configuration in Example 21-5 to set R1’s interface priority to 99.

The KILL signal destroys the process.\nKill (Terminate)\n$ kill 12445 - signal to kill a process. 12445 is the PID of the process to be killed.\nThis send a TERM signal. The SIGTERM signal is sent to a process to request it’s termination by allowing it to cleanly release its resources and saving it’s state.\n$ kill -9 12445 - specifying signal -9 (SIGKILL) to kill the process.\n- SIGHUP - Hangup, sent to a process when the controlling terminal is closed.\n- SIGINT - Is an interrupt signal (Ctrl-C)\n- SIGTERM - Kill the process, but allow it to do some cleanup first.\n- SIGKILL - Kill the process, kill it with fire, no cleanup\n- SIGSTOP - Stop/ suspend a process\nniceness\nProcess take turns sharing the CPU.

That is one cause. However, more loss happens because of the normal operation of the networking devices, in which the devices’ queues get too full, so the device has nowhere to put new packets, and it discards the packet.\nTypes of Traffic\nData Applications\nHTTP GET 500 Packets Figure 11-1 Concept of Disproportionate Packet/Byte Volumes with HTTP Traffic “\u003e\nQuality of Experience (QoE) - users’ perception of their use of the application on the network.\nVoice and Video Applications\nA flow is all the data moving from one application to another over the network, with one flow for each direction\nFor example, if you open a website and connect to a web server, the web page content that moves from the server to the client is one flow.\nFrom a voice perspective, a phone call between two IP phones would create a flow for each direction\nStep 1. The phone user makes a phone call and begins speaking.\nStep 2. A chip called a codec processes (digitizes) the sound to create a binary code (160 bytes with the G.711 codec, for example) for a certain time period (usually 20 ms).\nStep 3. The phone places the data into an IP packet.\nStep 4.

Like ACLs, QoS tools are enabled on an interface. Also like ACLs, QoS tools are enabled for a direction: packets entering the interface (before the forwarding decision) or for messages exiting the interface (after the forwarding decision).\nclassification refers to the process of matching the fields in a message to make a choice to take some QoS action\nQoS tools perform classification (matching of header fields) to decide which packets to take certain QoS actions against. Those actions include the other types of QoS tools discussed in this chapter, such as queuing, shaping, policing, and so on.\nForward RI Classify Queue Scheduling (Prioritization) Transmit Figure 11-3 Big Idea: Classification for Queuing in a Router “\u003e\nMatching (Classification) Basics\nCisco and by RFCs, suggests doing complex matching early in the life of a packet and then marking the packet.

The original RFC defined a 3-bit IP Precedence (IPP) field for QoS marking. That field gave us eight separate values—binary 000, 001, 010, and so on, through 111—which when converted to decimal are decimals 0 through 7.\nIPP Type of Service DSCP RFC 2474 Unused ECN Old Use IP Header (Rest of IP Header…) Current Use RFC 3168 Figure 11-6 IP Precedence and Differentiated Services Code Point Fields “\u003e\nThose last 5 bits of the ToS byte per RFC 791 were mostly defined for some purpose but were not used in practice to any significant extent.\nDSCP increased the number of marking bits to 6 bits, allowing for 64 unique values that can be marked. The DiffServ RFCs, which became RFCs back in the late 1990s, have become accepted as the most common method to use when doing QoS, and using the DSCP field for marking has become quite common.\nIPv6 has a similar field to mark as well. The 6-bit field also goes by the name DSCP, with the byte in the IPv6 header being called the IPv6 Traffic Class byte.\nMarking the Ethernet 802.1Q Header\nmarking field exists in the 802.1Q header\nIt goes by two different names: Class of Service, or CoS, and Priority Code Point, or PCP.\nsits in the third byte of the 4-byte 802.1Q header, as a 3-bit field, supplying eight possible values to mark (see Figure 11-7).

They can use either the Cisco-proprietary and STP-based PVST+, Cisco-proprietary and RSTP-based RPVST+, or the IEEE standard MSTP.\nMSTP allows the definition of as many instances (multiple spanning tree instances, or MSTIs) as chosen by the network designer but does not require one per VLAN.\nSTP and MSTP now exist as part of the 802.1Q standard, which defines VLANs and VLAN trunking.\nThe revised rules divide the original priority field into two separate fields, as shown in Figure 10-4: a 4-bit priority field and a 12-bit subfield called the system ID extension (which represents the VLAN ID\nCisco switches let you configure the BID, but only the priority part.\nThe switch fills in its universal (burned-in) MAC address as the system ID. It also plugs in the VLAN ID of a VLAN in the 12-bit system ID extension field; you cannot change that behavior either. The only part configurable by the network engineer is the 4-bit priority field.\nthe configuration command (spanning-tree vlan vlan-id priority x) requires a decimal number between 0 and 65,535. But not just any number in that range will suffice; it must be a multiple of 4096, as emphasized in the help text shown in Example 10-2.\n#spanning-tree vlan x root primary (on the switch that should be primary)\n#spanning-tree vlan x root secondary (on the switch that should be secondary)\nThese two commands cause the switch to make a choice of priority value but then store the chosen priority value in the spanning-tree vlan x priority value command. The command with root primary or root secondary does not appear in the configuration. When configuring root primary, the switch looks at the priority of the current root switch and chooses either (a) 24,576 or (b) 4096 less than the current root’s priority (if the current root’s priority is 24,576 or less) to the configuration instead. When configuring, root secondary always results in that switch using a priority of 28,672, with the assumption that the value will be less than other switches that use the default of 32,768, and higher than any switch configured as root primary.\nHow Switches Use the Priority and System ID Extension\nCisco Catalyst switches configure the priority value using a number that represents a 16-bit value; however, the system ID extension exists as the low-order 12 bits of that same number.\nWhen the switch builds its BID to use for RSTP in a VLAN, it must combine the configured priority with the VLAN ID of that VLAN.\nthe configured priority results in a 16-bit priority that always ends with 12 binary 0s.\nRoot Switch: 24,576 (priority) + 9 (VLAN ID) = 24585\nLocal Switch: 32,768 (priority) + 9 (VLAN ID) = 32777\nRSTP Methods to Support Multiple Spanning Trees\nRSTP creates one tree—the Common Spanning Tree (CST)—while RPVST+ creates one tree for each and every VLAN.\nRSTP sends one set of RSTP messages (BPDUs) in the network, no matter the number of VLANs, while RPVST+ sends one set of messages per VLAN.\nRSTP and RPVST+ use different destination MAC addresses: RSTP with multicast address 0180.C200.0000 (an address defined in the IEEE standard), and RPVST+ with multicast address 0100.0CCC.CCCD (an address chosen by Cisco).\nWhen transmitting messages on VLAN trunks, RSTP sends the messages in the native VLAN with no VLAN header/tag. RPVST+ sends each VLAN’s messages inside that VLAN—for instance, BPDUs about VLAN 9 have an 802.1Q header that lists VLAN 9.\nRPVST+ adds an extra type-length value (TLV) to the BPDU that identifies the VLAN ID, while RSTP does not (because it does not need to, as RSTP ignores VLANs.)\nBoth view the 16-bit priority as having a 12-bit System ID Extension, with RSTP setting the value to 0000.0000.0000, meaning “no VLAN,” while RPVST+ uses the VLAN ID.\nOther RSTP Configuration Options\nSwitch Priority: The global command spanning-tree vlan x priority y lets an engineer set the switch’s priority in that VLAN.\nPrimary and Secondary Root Switches: The global command spanning-tree vlan x root primary | secondary also lets you set the priority, but the switch decides on a value to make that switch likely to be the primary root switch (the root) or the secondary root switch (the switch that becomes root if the primary fails).\nPort Costs: The interface subcommand spanning-tree [vlan x] cost y lets an engineer set the switch’s STP/RSTP cost on that port, either for all VLANs or for a specific VLAN on that port. Changing those costs then changes the root cost for some switches, which impacts the choice of root ports and designated ports.",

I will include some helpful Vagrant commands at the end if you get stuck.\nIn this guide, I will be using Fedora 38 as my main operating system. I use Fedora because it is similar in features to Red Hat Linux Distributions. This will give me even more practice for the RHCSA exam as I use it in day-to-day operations.\nNote, if you are using Windows, you will need to install ssh. This can be done by installing Git. Which automatically installs ssh for you.\nYou will also need to have the latest version of Virtualbox installed.\nHere are the steps: Download and install Vagrant Make a new directory for your vagrant lab to live in Add the vagrant box Install the Vagrant disk size plugin Initialize the Vagrant box and Edit the Vagrant file Bring up the Vagrant box 1. Download and install Vagrant. In Fedora, this is very easy. Run the following command to download and install Vagrant:\nsudo dnf install vagrant\n2. Make a new directory for your vagrant lab to live in. Make your vagrant directory and make it your current working directory:\ncd Vagrant Add the Vagrant box. vagrant box add generic/rhel8\nInstall the Vagrant disk size plugin. The disk size program will help us set up custom storage sizes. Since we will be re-partitioning storage, this is a useful feature.\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize\nInitialize the Vagrant box and edit the Vagrant file. First, initialize the Vagrant box in the vagrant directory: vagrant init generic/rhel8\nAfter completion, there will now be a file called “Vagrantfile” in your current directory. Since Vim is on the RHCSA exam, it’s wise to practice with it whenever you can. So let’s open the file in Vim:\nvim Vagrantfile\nYou will see a bunch of lines commented out, and a few lines without comments. Go ahead and comment out everything and paste this at the end of the file:\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config config.vm.box = \"generic/rhel8\" config.vm.define \"server1\" do |server1| server1.vm.hostname = \"server1.example.com\" server1.vm.network \"private_network\", ip: \"192.168.2.110\" config.disksize.size = '10GB' end config.vm.define \"server2\" do |server2| server2.vm.hostname = \"server2.example.com\" server2.vm.network \"private_network\", ip: \"192.168.2.120\" config.disksize.size = '16GB' end config.vm.provider \"virtualbox\" do |vb| vb.memory = \"2048\" end end|The configuration file is fairly self-explanatory. Save Vagrantfile and exit Vim. Then, create /etc/vbox/networks.conf and add the following:\n* 10.0.0.0/8 192.168.0.0/1 * 2001::/646This will allow you to be more flexible with what network addresses can be used in VirtualBox.\nBring up the Vagrant box. Now, we bring up the Vagrant box. This will open two Virtual machines in Virtualbox named server1 and server2 in headless mode (there is no GUI).\nvagrant up\nGreat! Now we can use Vagrant to ssh into server1:\nvagrant ssh server 1\nFrom server1 ssh into server2 using its IP address:\n[vagrant@server1 ~]$ ssh 192.168.2.120\nNow you are in and ready to stir things up. The last thing you need is some commands to manage your Vagrant machines.\nHelpful Vagrant commands. Shut down Vagrant machines:\nvagrant halt Suspend or resume a machine:\nvagrant suspend vagrand resumeRestart a virtual machine:\nvagrant reload\nDestroy a Vagrant machine:\nvagrant destroy [machine-name]\nShow running VMs:\nvagrant status\nList other Vagrant options:\nvagrant\nIf you are going for RHCSA, there is no doubt that you will also use Vagrant sometime in the future. And as you can see, it’s pretty quick and simple to get started.\nFeel free to reach out with questions.",

Use the sdm prefer lanbase-routing command (or similar) in global configuration mode to change the switch forwarding ASIC settings to make space for IPv4 routes at the next reload of the switch.\nB. Use the reload EXEC command in enable mode to reload (reboot) the switch to pick up the new sdm prefer command setting.\nC. Once reloaded, use the ip routing command in global configuration mode to enable the IPv4 routing function in IOS software and to enable key commands like show ip route.\nif you then enabled OSPF on the Layer 3 switch, the configuration and verification would work the same as it does on a router, as discussed in Chapter 20, “Implementing OSPF.” The routes that IOS adds to the Layer 3 switch’s IP routing table would list the VLAN interfaces as outgoing interfaces.\nTroubleshooting Routing with SVIs\nlook to those first few configuration commands listed in the configuration checklist found in the earlier section “Configuring Routing Using Switch SVIs.” Those commands are sdm prefer (followed by a reload) and then ip routing (after the reload).\nThe sdm prefer command changes how the switch forwarding chips allocate memory for different forwarding tables, and changes to those tables require a reload of the switch. By default, many access switches that support Layer 3 switching still have an SDM default that does not allocate space for an IP routing table. Once changed and reloaded, the ip routing command then enables IPv4 routing in IOS software. Both are necessary before some Cisco switches will act as a Layer 3 switch.\nScenario 1: The last access interface in VLAN 10 is shut down (F0/1), so IOS shuts down the VLAN 10 interface.\nScenario 2: VLAN 20 (not VLAN interface 20, but VLAN 20) is deleted, which results in IOS then bringing down (not shutting down) the VLAN 20 interface.\nScenario 3: VLAN 30 (not VLAN interface 30, but VLAN 30) is shut down, which results in IOS then bringing down (not shutting down) the VLAN 30 interface.\nVLAN Routing with Layer 3 Switch Routed Ports\nOn a routed port, the switch does not perform Layer 2 switching logic on that frame. Instead, frames arriving in a routed port trigger the Layer 3 routing logic, including\nStripping off the incoming frame’s Ethernet data-link header/trailer\nMaking a Layer 3 forwarding decision by comparing the destination IP address to the IP routing table\nAdding a new Ethernet data-link header/trailer to the packet\nForwarding the packet, encapsulated in a new frame\nThe exam topics do not mention routed interfaces specifically, but the exam topics do mention L3 EtherChannels, meaning Layer 3 EtherChannels.\nImplementing Routed Interfaces on Switches\nEnabling a switch interface to be a routed interface instead of a switched interface is simple: just use the no switchport subcommand on the physical interface.\nTo make the port stop acting like a switch port and instead act like a router port, use the no switchport command on the interface.\nOnce the port is acting as a routed port, think of it like a router interface\nthe routed interface will show up differently in command output in the switch. In particular, for an interface configured as a routed port with an IP address, like interface GigabitEthernet0/1 in the previous example:\nKey Topic.\nshow interfaces: Similar to the same command on a router, the output will display the IP address of the interface. (Conversely, for switch ports, this command does not list an IP address.)\nshow interfaces status: Under the “VLAN” heading, instead of listing the access VLAN or the word trunk, the output lists the word routed, meaning that it is a routed port.\nshow ip route: Lists the routed port as an outgoing interface in routes.\nshow interfaces type number switchport: If a routed port, the output is short and confirms that the port is not a switch port. (If the port is a Layer 2 port, this command lists many configuration and status details.)\nAll the ports that are links directly between the Layer 3 switches can be routed interfaces.\nImplementing Layer 3 EtherChannels\neach pair of switches has one routing protocol neighbor relationship with the neighbor, and not two. Each switch learns one route per destination per pair of links, and not two. IOS then balances the traffic, often with better balancing than the balancing that occurs with the use of multiple IP routes to the same subnet.\nStep 1. Configure the physical interfaces as follows, in interface configuration mode:\nA. Add the channel-group number mode on command to add it to the channel. Use the same number for all physical interfaces on the same switch, but the number used (the channel-group number) can differ on the two neighboring switches.\nB. Add the no switchport command to make each physical port a routed port.\nStep 2. Configure the PortChannel interface:\nA. Use the interface port-channel number command to move to port-channel configuration mode for the same channel number configured on the physical interfaces.\nB. Add the no switchport command to make sure that the port-channel interface acts as a routed port. (IOS may have already added this command.)\nC. Use the ip address address mask command to configure the address and mask.\nCisco uses the term EtherChannel in concepts discussed in this section and then uses the term PortChannel, with command keyword port-channel, when verifying and configuring EtherChannels.\nalthough the physical interfaces and PortChannel interface are all routed ports, the IP address should be placed on the PortChannel interface only. In fact, when the no switchport command is configured on an interface, IOS adds the no ip address command to the interface.\nTroubleshooting Layer 3 EtherChannels\nlook at the configuration of the channel-group command, which enables an interface for an EtherChannel. Second, you should check a list of settings that must match on the interfaces for a Layer 3 EtherChannel to work correctly.\nAs for the channel-group interface subcommand, this command can enable EtherChannel statically or dynamically. If dynamic, this command’s keywords imply either Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) or Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) as the protocol to negotiate between the neighboring switches whether they put the link into the EtherChannel.\nno switchport: The PortChannel interface must be configured with the no switchport command, and so must the physical interfaces.\nSpeed: The physical ports in the channel must use the same speed.\nduplex: The physical ports in the channel must use the same duplex.",

A switch’s RP is its interface through which it has the least STP/RSTP cost to reach the root switch (least root cost).\nChoosing Each Switch’s Root Port\neach nonroot switch chooses its one and only root port.\nits interface through which it has the least STP/RSTP cost to reach the root switch (least root cost).\nThe STP/RSTP port cost is simply an integer value assigned to each interface, per VLAN\nThe switches also look at their neighbor’s root cost, as announced in Hello BPDUs received from each neighbor.\n![Root Cost = O SWI GO/I GiO'2 Root Cost = O RootCostoutGO/1 is 5 Root Cost out GO,‘2 is 8 0+5=5 cost 5 Cost = 4 GiO,Q SW3 4 Cost 4 GiO,Q My Root Cost Out GOO is 4 sv-V2 GiO'1 Root Cost = 4\nSW3 calculates its cost to reach the root over the two possible paths by adding the advertised cost (in Hello messages) to the interface costs listed in the figure.\nThe root switch sends Hellos, with a listed root cost of 0. The idea is that the root’s cost to reach itself is 0.\nEach switch places its root port into a forwarding state.\ntiebreaker to use in case the best root cost ties for two or more paths.\nChoose based on the lowest neighbor bridge ID.\nChoose based on the lowest neighbor port priority.\nChoose based on the lowest neighbor internal port number.\nChoosing the Designated Port on each LAN Segment\nfinal step to choose the STP/RSTP topology is to choose the designated port on each LAN segment.\nThe designated port (DP) on each LAN segment is the switch port that advertises the lowest-cost Hello onto a LAN segment.\nWhen a nonroot switch forwards a Hello, the nonroot switch sets the root cost field in the Hello to that switch’s cost to reach the root. In effect, the switch with the lower cost to reach the root, among all switches connected to a segment, becomes the DP on that segment.\nAll DPs are placed into a forwarding state\nTwo additional tiebreakers are needed in some cases\nthese would be unlikely today.\nA single switch can connect two or more interfaces to the same collision domain by connecting to a hub.\nIn that case, the one switch hears its own BPDUs.\nSo, if a switch ties with itself, two additional tiebreakers are used:\nthe lowest interface STP/RSTP priority and,\nif that ties, the lowest internal interface number.\nswitch ports connected to endpoint devices should become DPs and settle into a forwarding state.\nConfiguring to influence the STP Topology\nconfigure the bridge ID and change STP/RSTP port costs.\nchange the BID, the engineer can\nset the priority used by the switch, while\ncontinues to use the universal MAC address as the final 48 bits of the BID.\ngiving a switch the lowest priority value among all switches will cause that switch to win the root election.\nto favor one link, give the ports on that link a lower cost, or to avoid a link, give the ports a higher cost.\nLink Costs\n10 Mbps\n2,000,000 100 (old) 100Mbps\n200,000 19 (old) 1gbps\n20,000 4 (old) 10Gbps\n2000 2 (old) 100Gbps\n200 N/A (old) 1Tbps\n20\nN/A (old)\nthe cost defaults based on the operating speed of the link, not the maximum speed\n(config) # spanning-tree pathcost method long\nCisco Catalyst switches can be configured to use the long values as defaults\nDetails specific to STP\nSTP Activity When the Network Remains Stable\nAn STP root switch sends a new Hello BPDU every 2 seconds by default.\nEach nonroot switch forwards the Hello on all DPs, but only after changing items listed in the Hello.\n(As a result, the Hello flows once over every working link in the LAN.)\nWhen forwarding the Hello BPDU, each switch sets the root cost to that local switch’s calculated root cost. The switch also sets the “sender’s bridge ID” field to its own bridge ID. (The root’s bridge ID field is not changed.)\nStep 1. The root creates and sends a Hello BPDU, with a root cost of 0, out all its working interfaces (those in a forwarding state).\nStep 2. The nonroot switches receive the Hello on their root ports. After changing the Hello to list their own BID as the sender’s BID and listing that switch’s root cost, the switch forwards the Hello out all designated ports.\nStep 3. Steps 1 and 2 repeat until something changes.\nWhen a switch ceases to receive the Hellos, or receives a Hello that lists different details, something has failed, so the switch reacts and starts the process of changing the spanning-tree topology. STP Timers That Manage STP Convergence\nSTP convergence process requires the use of three timers\nAll switches use the timers as dictated by the root switch, which the root lists in its periodic Hello BPDU messages.\nhello\n2 seconds by default Period between hellos created by the root MaxAge\n10 times the hello (20 seconds by default hello) How long the switch will go without receiving any hellos before it attempts to change the stp topology Forward Delay\n15 seconds\nhow long the port stays in listening and learning state\nAfter MaxAge expires, the switch essentially makes all its STP choices again, based on any Hellos it receives from other switches.\nChanging Interface States with STP\nRoles, like root port and designated port, relate to how STP analyzes the LAN topology. States, like forwarding and blocking, tell a switch whether to send or receive frames.\nWhen STP converges, a switch chooses new port roles, and the port roles determine the state (forwarding or blocking).\nSwitches using STP can simply move immediately from forwarding to blocking state, but they must take extra time to transition from blocking state to forwarding state.\nwhen a port that formerly blocked needs to transition to forwarding, the switch first puts the port through two intermediate interface states.\nListening:\ninterface does not forward frames. switch removes old stale (unused) MAC table entries for which no frames are received from each MAC address during this period. These stale MAC table entries could be the cause of the temporary loops. Transitory Learning:\ndo not forward frames switch begins to learn the MAC addresses of frames received on the interface. Transitory Blocking\ndoes not forward frames does not learn mac addresses stable Forwarding\nlearns mac addresses forwards frames stable Disabled\ndoes not forward or learn mac addresses stable blocking \u003e listening, \u003e learning \u003e forwarding.\nSTP leaves the interface in each interim state for a time equal to the forward delay timer, which defaults to 15 seconds.\na convergence event that causes an interface to change from blocking to forwarding requires 30 seconds to transition from blocking to forwarding.\na switch might have to wait MaxAge seconds (default 20 seconds) before even choosing to move an interface from blocking to forwarding state.\nRapid STP Concepts\n802.1w Sits in 802.1q standards document Comparing STP and RSTP\nsimilarities\nelect the root switch using the same rules and tiebreakers.\nswitches select their root ports with the same rules.\nelect designated ports on each LAN segment with the same rules and tiebreakers.\nplace each port in either forwarding or blocking state\n(RSTP calls the blocking state the discarding state.)\nthey can both be used in the same network.\nRSTP improves network convergence when topology changes occur, usually converging within a few seconds (or in slow conditions, in about 10 seconds).\nRSTP defines more cases in which the switch can avoid waiting for a timer to expire, such as the following:\na switch can replace its root port, without any waiting to reach a forwarding state (in some conditions).\nreplace a designated port, without any waiting to reach a forwarding state (in some conditions).\nlowers waiting times for cases in which RSTP must wait for a timer.\nMaxAge is only 3 times the hello\nuses the term alternate port to refer to a switch’s other ports that could be used as the root port if the root port ever fails.\nThe backup port concept provides a backup port on the local switch for a designated port.\nbackup ports apply only to designs that use hubs, so they are unlikely to be useful today.)\nRSTP Port roles\nRoot Port\nNonroot switch’s port that has the best path to the root Alternate port\nReplaces the root port when the root port fails Designated port\nport designated to forward onto a collision domain Backup Port\nReplaces designated port when designated port fails Disabled ports\nadministratively disabled\neach switch independently generates its own Hellos.\nallows for queries between neighbors\n(rather than waiting on timers to expire to learn new information)\nRSTP and the Alternate (Root) Port Role\nalternate port\nboth the RP and the alternate port must receive Hellos that identify the same root switch. the switch changes the former root port’s role and state:\nthe role from root port to a disabled port, and\nthe state from forwarding to discarding\nwithout waiting on any timers, the switch changes roles and state for the alternate port:\nits role changes to be the root port, with a forwarding state.\nthe new root port also does not need to spend time in other states, such as learning state, instead moving immediately to forwarding state.\nStep 1. The link between SW1 and SW3 fails, so SW3’s current root port (Gi0/1) fails.\nStep 2. SW3 and SW2 exchange RSTP messages to confirm that SW3 will now transition its former alternate port (Gi0/2) to be the root port. This action causes SW2 to flush the required MAC table entries.\nStep 3. SW3 transitions Gi0/1 to the disabled role and Gi0/2 to the root port role.\nStep 4. SW3 transitions Gi0/2 to a forwarding state immediately, without using learning state, because this is one case in which RSTP knows the transition will not create a loop.\nRSTP States and Processes\nRSTP keeps both the learning and forwarding states as compared with STP, for the same purposes\nRSTP does not even define a listening state,\nRSTP renames the blocking state to the discarding state and redefines its use slightly.\nRSTP uses the discarding state for what STP defines as two states: disabled state and blocking state.\n![Table 9-10 Port States Compared: STP and RSTP Function Port is administratively disabled Stable state that ignores incoming data frames and is not used to forward data frames Interim state without MAC learning and without forwarding Interim state with MAC learning and without forwarding Stable state that allows MAC learning and forwarding of data STP State Disabled Blocking Listening Learning Forward- RSTp State Discard- Discard- Not used Learning Forward\nRSTP switches tell each other (using messages) that the topology has changed.\nThose messages also direct neighboring switches to flush the contents of their MAC tables in a way that removes all the potentially loop-causing entries, without a wait.\nRSTP backup port role creates a way for RSTP to quickly replace a switch’s designated port on some LAN.\nRSTP Port Types\nseveral links between two switches. RSTP considers these links to be point-to-point links and the ports connected to them to be point-to-point ports Point-to-point port SWI SW3 Point-to-point Edge Port Point-to-point Port SW2 swa Shared Port Hub\nPorts that instead connect to a single endpoint device at the edge of the network, like a PC or server, are called point-to-point edge ports, or simply edge ports.\n“shared” to describe ports connected to a hub.\nhubs also force the attached switch port to use half-duplex logic. RSTP assumes that all half-duplex ports may be connected to hubs, treating ports that use half duplex as shared ports.\nRSTP converges more slowly on shared ports as compared to all point-to-point ports.\nOptional STP Features\nEtherchannel The switches treat the EtherChannel as a single interface with regard to STP. Layer 2 EtherChannels combine links that switches use as switch ports, with the switches using Layer 2 switching logic to forward and receive Ethernet frames over the EtherChannels. Layer 3 EtherChannels also combine links, but the switches use Layer 3 routing logic to forward packets over the EtherChannels.\nPortFast\nPortFast\nallows a switch to immediately transition from blocking to forwarding, bypassing listening and learning states.\nonly ports on which you can safely enable PortFast are ports on which you know that no bridges, switches, or other STP-speaking devices are connected.\nCisco switches enable RSTP point-to-point edge ports by enabling PortFast on the port.\nBPDU Guard An attacker could connect a switch to a port with a low STP/RSTP priority value. And make itself the root switch. The new STP/RSTP topology could have worse performance than the desired topology.\nThe attacker could plug into multiple ports, into multiple switches, become root, and actually forward much of the traffic in the LAN. Without the networking staff realizing it, the attacker could use a LAN analyzer to copy large numbers of data frames sent through the LAN.\nUsers could innocently harm the LAN when they buy and connect an inexpensive consumer LAN switch (one that does not use STP/RSTP). Such a switch, without any STP/RSTP function, would not choose to block any ports and could cause a loop.\nCisco BPDU Guard feature helps defeat these kinds of problems by disabling a port if any BPDUs are received on the port. So, this feature is particularly useful on ports that should be used only as an access port and never connected to another switch.\nIn addition, the BPDU Guard feature helps prevent problems with PortFast. PortFast should be enabled only on access ports that connect to user devices, not to other LAN switches. Using BPDU Guard on these same ports makes sense because if another switch connects to such a port, the local switch can disable the port before a loop is created.",

If the destination is local, send directly:\nA. ‘‘Find the destination host’s MAC address. Use the already-known Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table entry, or use ARP messages to learn the information.\nB. Encapsulate the IP packet in a data-link frame, with the destination data-link address of the destination host.\nFor each received data-link frame, choose whether or not to process the frame. Process it if\nThe frame has no errors (per the data-link trailer Frame Check Sequence [FCS] field).\nThe frame’s destination data-link address is the router’s address (or an appropriate multicast or broadcast address).\nIf choosing to process the frame at Step 1, de-encapsulate the packet from inside the data-link frame.\nMake a routing decision. To do so, compare the packet’s destination IP address to the routing table and find the route that matches the destination address. This route identifies the outgoing interface of the router and possibly the next-hop router.\nEncapsulate the packet into a data-link frame appropriate for the outgoing interface. When forwarding out LAN interfaces, use ARP as needed to find the next device’s MAC address.\nTransmit the frame out the outgoing interface, as listed in the matched IP route.\nThe interface is in a working state. In other words, the interface status in the show interfaces command lists a line status of up and a protocol status of up. The interface has an IP address assigned through the ip address interface subcommand. Routing Protocol Code: The legend at the top of the show ip route output (about nine lines) lists all the routing protocol codes (exam topic 3.1.a). This book references the codes for connected routes (C), local (L), static (S), and OSPF (O).\nPrefix: The word prefix (exam topic 3.1.b) is just another name for subnet ID.\nMask: Each route lists a prefix (subnet ID) and network mask (exam topic 3.1.c) in prefix format, for example, /24.\nThe ARP Table on a Cisco Router\nDynamically learned ARP table entries have an upward counter, like the 35-minute value for the ARP table entry for IP address 172.16.1.9. By default, IOS will time out (remove) an ARP table entry after 240 minutes in which the entry is not used.\nclear ip arp [ip-address] EXEC command.\nConfiguring Static Routes\nThe static route is considered a network route when the destination listed in the ip route command defines a subnet, or an entire Class A, B, or C network. In contrast, a default route matches all destination IP addresses, while a host route matches a single IP address (that is, an address of one host.)\nHowever, the route that used the outgoing interface configuration is also noted as a connected route; this is just a quirk of the output of the show ip route command.\nalso lists a few statistics about all IPv4 routes. For example, the example shows two lines, for the two static routes configured in Example 16-4, but statistics state that this router has routes for eight subnets.\nIOS adds and removes these static routes dynamically over time, based on whether the outgoing interface is working or not. For example, in this case, if R1’s S0/0/0 interface fails, R1 removes the static route to 172.16.2.0/24 from the IPv4 routing table. Later, when the interface comes up again, IOS adds the route back to the routing table.\nStatic Host Routes\nTo configure such a static route, the ip route command uses an IP address plus a mask of 255.255.255.255 so that the matching logic matches just that one address.\nAn engineer might use host routes to direct packets sent to one host over one path, with all other traffic to that host’s subnet over some other path. For instance, you could define these two static routes for subnet 10.1.1.0/24 and host 10.1.1.9, with two different next-hop addresses, as follows:\nrouters use the most specific route (that is, the route with the longest prefix length)\nFloating Static Routes\nthe router must first decide which routing source has the better administrative distance, with lower being better, and then use the route learned from the better source\nBy default, IOS considers static routes better than OSPF-learned routes. By default, IOS gives static routes an administrative distance of 1 and OSPF routes an administrative distance of 110\nTo implement a floating static route, you need to use a parameter on the ip route command that sets the administrative distance for just that route, making the value larger than the default administrative distance of the routing protocol. For example, the ip route 172.16.2.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.5.3 130\nwhile the show ip route command lists the administrative distance of most routes, as the first of two numbers inside two brackets, the show ip route subnet command plainly lists the administrative distance.\nStatic Default Routes\nip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 S0/0/1 creates a static default route on Router B1—a route that matches all IP packets—and sends those packets out interface S0/0/1.\nshow ip route\na *, meaning it is a candidate default route. A router can learn about more than one default route, and the router then has to choose which one to use; the * means that it is at least a candidate to become the default route.\nTroubleshooting Static Routes\nThe route is in the routing table but is incorrect.\nIs there a subnetting math error in the subnet ID and mask?\nIs the next-hop IP address correct and referencing an IP address on a neighboring router?\nDoes the next-hop IP address identify the correct router?\nIs the outgoing interface correct, and referencing an interface on the local router (that is, the same router where the static route is configured)?\nThe route is not in the routing table.\ntable. IOS also considers the following before adding the route to its routing table:\nFor ip route commands that list an outgoing interface, that interface must be in an up/up state.\nFor ip route commands that list a next-hop IP address, the local router must have a route to reach that next-hop address.\nYou can configure a static route so that IOS ignores these basic checks, always putting the IP route in the routing table. To do so, just use the permanent keyword on the ip route command. For example, by adding the permanent keyword to the end of the two commands as demonstrated in Example 16-7, R1 would now add these routes, regardless of whether the two WAN links were up.\nThe route is in the routing table and is correct, but the packets do not arrive at the destination host.\nMany legitimate router features can cause these multiple routes to appear in a router’s routing table, including\nStatic routes Route autosummarization Manual route summarization When a particular destination IP address matches more than one route in a router’s IPv4 routing table, the router uses the most specific route—in other words, the route with the longest prefix length mask.\nA second way to identify the route a router will use, one that does not require any subnetting math, is the show ip route address command. The last parameter on this command is the IP address of an assumed IP packet. The router replies by listing the route it would use to route a packet sent to that address.",

A log file that keeps track of what you are doing when moving files. Will keep track of where you left off in case the system loses power.\nCommon Desktop Filesystem types\next4 - This is the most current version of native Linux filesystems. Compatible with the older ext2 and ext3 versions. Supports disk volumes up to 1 exabyte and file sizes up yo 16 terabytes and more. Standard choice for Linux filesystems.\nBtrfs - “Better or Butter FS” it is a new filesystem for Linux that comes with snapshots, incremental backups, performance increase and much more. It is widely available, but not quite stable/ compatible yet.\nXFS - High performance journaling file system, great for system with large files such as media server,\nNTFS and FAT - Windows Filesystems\nHFS+ - Macintosh filesystem\n$ df -T\nreports filesystem disk space usage and other details about your disk.\nAnatomy of a disk\nPartition table\nEvery disk has a partition tables that shows the system how the disk is partitioned. It shows how partitions begin and end, which partitions are bootable, what sectors of the disk are allocated to what partition, etc. There are two main partition tables schemes used, Master Boot Record (MBR) and GUID Partition Table (GAPT)\nPartition\nPartitions can’t overlap each other. Free space is disk space that is not allocated to a partition.\nMBR\n- Traditional partition table\n- Can have primary, extended, and logical partitions\n- MBR has a limit of four primary partitions\n- Additional partitions can be made by making a primary partition into an extended partition (there can only be one extended partition on a disk). Then inside the extended partition you add logical partitions.\n- Supports disks up to 2 Terabytes.\nGPT\n- GUID Partition Table (GPT) is becoming the new standard for disk partitioning.\n- Has only one type of partition and you can make many of them.\n- Used mostly in conjunction with UEFI based booting\nFilesystem structure\nBoot block\nLocated int the first few sectors of the filesystem. It is not really used by the filesystem. It contains information used to boot the operating system. Only one boot block is needed by the operating system. There are unused boot blocks in partitions that don’t have boot info.\nSuper block\nA single block that comes after the boot block that contains info about the filesystem. Info includes the size of the inode table, size of logical blocks , and size of the filesystem.\nInode table\nThe database that manages files. Each file or directory has a unique entry in the inode table and it has various info about the file.\nData blocks\nThe actual data for the files and directories.\n$ sudo parted -l\nto view a partition table\nDisk /dev/sda: 21. 5GB Sector size (logical/phystcal) Partition Table: msdos Disk Flags: Number start 1049kB 539MB 539MB End 538MB 21.5GB 21.5GB size 537MB 20 .9GB 20 .9GB 51281512B T ype primary extended Logical File system fa t32 Flags boot “\u003e ( MBR example )\nDisk Partitioning\nTools to partition a disk\nfdisk - basic command-line partitioning tool, it does not support GPT\nparted - command line tool that supports both MBR and GPT partitioning\ngparted - GUI version of parted\ngdisk - fdisk, but only supports GPT\n$ sudo parted\nEnters the parted tool\nselect /dev/sdb2\nselects the device\nmkpart primary 123 4567\nto make the partition\n$ resize 2 1234 3456\nto resize a partition. Select the partition number and then start and end points of where you want to resize it to.\nCreating filesystems\n$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb2\nAllows you to specify the type of filesystem and where it goes.

DHCP problems: If you are using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), many problems could exist. VLAN trunking problems: The router could be configured for 802.1Q trunking, when the switch is not (or vice versa). LAN problems: A wide variety of issues could exist with the Layer 2 switches, preventing any frames from flowing between host A and the router. Testing LAN Neighbors with Extended Ping\nan extended ping can test the host’s default router setting. Both tests can be useful, especially for problem isolation, because\nIf a standard ping of a local LAN host works… But an extended ping of the same LAN host fails… The problem likely relates somehow to the host’s default router setting. Testing WAN Neighbors with Standard Ping\nA successful ping of the IP address on the other end of an Ethernet WAN link that sits between two routers confirms several specific facts, such as the following:\nBoth routers’ WAN interfaces are in an up/up state.\nThe Layer 1 and 2 features of the link work.\nThe routers believe that the neighboring router’s IP address is in the same subnet.\nInbound ACLs on both routers do not filter the incoming packets, respectively.\nThe remote router is configured with the expected IP address (172.16.4.2 in this case).\nUsing Ping with Names and with IP Addresses\nProblem Isolation Using the traceroute Command\nping vs Tracert\nBoth send messages in the network to test connectivity. Both rely on other devices to send back a reply. Both have wide support on many different operating systems. Both can use a hostname or an IP address to identify the destination. On routers, both have a standard and extended version, allowing better testing of the reverse route. Standard and Extended traceroute\na standard traceroute command chooses an IP address based on the outgoing interface for the packet sent by the command. So, in this example, the packets sent by R1 come from source IP address 172.16.4.1, R1’s G0/0/0 IP address.\nHost OS traceroute commands usually create ICMP echo requests. The Cisco IOS traceroute command instead creates IP packets with a UDP header. This bit of information may seem trivial at this point. However, note that an ACL may actually filter the traffic from a host’s traceroute messages but not the router traceroute command, or vice versa.\nTelnet and SSH",

Additionally, all the CE routers need to learn routes from the other CE routers—a process that relies on the PE routers.\nMPLS allows for many familiar routing protocols on the edge of the MPLS network: RIPv2, EIGRP, OSPF, and even eBGP\nOSPF CEI PEI 10.1.2.0/24 OSPF CE2 10.1.3.0/24 OSPF CE3 10.1.4.0/24 O SPF CE4\nA CE router does become neighbors with the PE router on the other end of the access link.\nA CE router does not become neighbors with other CE routers.\nThe MPLS network does advertise the customer’s routes between the various PE routers so that the CE routers can learn all customer routes through their PE-CE routing protocol neighbor relationship.\nTo advertise the customer routes between the PE routers, the PE routers use another routing protocol along with a process called route redistribution. Route redistribution happens inside one router, taking routes from one routing protocol process and injecting them into another. MPLS does route redistribution in the PE routers between the routing protocol used by the customer and a variation of BGP called Multiprotocol BGP (MPBGP).

Today’s web browsers support HTTPS (with TLS) as a way to dynamically create a secure connection from the web browser to a web server,\nTo do so, the browser creates a TCP connection to server well-known port 443 (default) and then initializes a TLS session. TLS encrypts data sent between the browser and the server and authenticating the user. Then, the HTTP messages flow over the TLS VPN connection.\nSSL has been deprecated (see RFC 7568) and has been replaced by TLS.\neach session secures only the data sent in that session\ncan be used to create a client VPN that secures all packets from the device to a site by using a Cisco VPN client\nCisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client (or AnyConnect Client for short) is software that sits on a user’s PC and uses TLS to create one end of a VPN remote-access tunnel\nCisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client TLS H-rrps Web Browser Internet For All Traffic to the Ente rise Firewall LS For a Sin le Web Browser Session\nwhile the figure shows a firewall used at the main enterprise site, many types of devices can be used on the server side of a TLS connection as well.\nVPN Comparisons\nTable 14-4 Comparisons of Site-to-Site and Remote Access VPNs Typical security protocol Devices supported by one VPN (one or many) Typical use: on-demand or permanent Remote Access TLS One On-demand Site-to-Site IPsec Many Permanent “\u003e",

    "content": "This chapter covers the following exam topics:\n2.0 Network Access\n2.6 Compare Cisco Wireless Architectures and AP modes\nAutonomous AP Architecture\nVLANs must be trunked from the distribution layer switch (where routing commonly takes place) to the access layer, where they are extended further over a trunk link to the AP.\nTwo wireless users that are associated to the same autonomous AP can reach each other through the AP without having to pass up into the wired network\nAn autonomous AP must also be configured with a management IP address so that you can remotely manage it.\nconfigure SSIDs, VLANs, and many RF parameters like the channel and transmit power to be used.\nmanagement address is not normally part of any of the data VLANs, so a dedicated management VLAN (i.e., VLAN 10) must be added to the trunk links to reach the AP.\nEach AP must be configured and maintained individually unless you leverage a management platform such as Cisco Prime Infrastructure or Cisco DNA Center.\nThat might sound straightforward until you have to add a new VLAN and configure every switch and AP in your network to carry and support it.\nCloud-based AP Architecture\nCisco Meraki is cloud-based and offers centralized management of wireless, switched, and security networks built from Meraki products. For example, through the cloud networking service, you can configure and manage APs, monitor wireless performance and activity, generate reports, and so on.\nCisco Meraki APs can be deployed automatically, once you register with the Meraki cloud. Each AP will contact the cloud when it powers up and will self-configure. From that point on, you can manage the AP through the Meraki cloud dashboard.\nFrom the cloud, you can push out code upgrades and configuration changes to the APs in the enterprise\nadds the intelligence needed to automatically instruct each AP on which channel and transmit power level to use.\nCan also collect information from all of the APs about things such as RF interference, rogue or unexpected wireless devices that were overheard, and wireless usage statistics.\nThe data path from the wireless network to the wired network is very short; the autonomous AP links the two networks. Data to and from wireless clients does not have to travel up into the cloud and back; the cloud is used to bring management functions into the data plane.\nthe network in Figure 27-3 consists of two distinct paths—one for data traffic and another for management traffic, corresponding to the following two functions:\nDistribution Layer Access Layer Cisco Meraki APs Cisco Meraki Cloud Management Trunk Link Trunk Link Data Figure 27-3 Cisco Meraki Cloud-Based Wireless Network Architecture “\u003e\nA control plane: Traffic used to control, configure, manage, and monitor the AP itself\nA data plane: End-user traffic passing through the AP\nSplit-MAC Architectures\nThe real-time processes involve sending and receiving 802.11 frames, beacons, and probe messages. 802.11 data encryption is also handled in real time, on a per-packet basis. The AP must interact with wireless clients on some low level, known as the Media Access Control (MAC) layer. These functions must stay with the AP hardware, closest to the clients.\nThe management functions are not integral to handling frames over the RF channels, but are things that should be centrally administered. Therefore, those functions can be moved to a centrally located platform away from the AP.\nWhen the functions of an autonomous AP are divided, the AP hardware is known as a lightweight access point, and performs only the real-time 802.11 operation.\nthe AP is left with duties in Layers 1 and 2, where frames are moved into and out of the RF domain. The AP becomes totally dependent on the WLC for every other WLAN function, such as authenticating users, managing security policies, and even selecting RF channels and output power.\nThe lightweight AP-WLC division of labor is known as a split-MAC architecture, where the normal MAC operations are pulled apart into two distinct locations.\nthe AP and WLC can be located on the same VLAN or IP subnet, but they do not have to be\nCAPWAP relationship actually consists of two separate tunnels, as follows:\nCAPWAP control messages: Carries exchanges that are used to configure the AP and manage its operation. The control messages are authenticated and encrypted, so the AP is securely controlled by only the appropriate WLC, then transported over the control tunnel.\nCAPWAP data: Used for packets traveling to and from wireless clients that are associated with the AP. Data packets are transported over the data tunnel but are not encrypted by default. When data encryption is enabled for an AP, packets are protected with Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).\nEvery AP and WLC must also authenticate each other with digital certificates. An X.509 certificate is preinstalled in each device when it is purchased.\nNotice how VLAN 100 exists at the WLC and in the air as SSID 100, near the wireless clients—but not in between the AP and the WLC\nBecause the AP sits on the access layer where its CAPWAP tunnels terminate, it can use one IP address for both management and tunneling. No trunk link is needed because all of the VLANs it supports are encapsulated and tunneled as Layer 3 IP packets, rather than individual Layer 2 VLANs.\nAs the wireless network grows, the WLC simply builds more CAPWAP tunnels to reach more Aps\nWLC can begin offering a variety of additional functions:\nDynamic channel assignment: The WLC can automatically choose and configure the RF channel used by each AP, based on other active access points in the area.\nTransmit power optimization: The WLC can automatically set the transmit power of each AP based on the coverage area needed.\nSelf-healing wireless coverage: If an AP radio dies, the coverage hole can be “healed” by turning up the transmit power of surrounding APs automatically.\nFlexible client roaming: Clients can roam between APs with very fast roaming times.\nDynamic client load balancing: If two or more APs are positioned to cover the same geographic area, the WLC can associate clients with the least used AP. This distributes the client load across the APs.\nRF monitoring: The WLC manages each AP so that it scans channels to monitor the RF usage. By listening to a channel, the WLC can remotely gather information about RF interference, noise, signals from neighboring APs, and signals from rogue APs or ad hoc clients.\nSecurity management: The WLC can authenticate clients from a central service and can require wireless clients to obtain an IP address from a trusted DHCP server before allowing them to associate and access the WLAN.\nWireless intrusion protection system: Leveraging its central location, the WLC can monitor client data to detect and prevent malicious activity.\nComparing Wireless LAN Controller Deployments\nlocate the WLC in a central location so that you can maximize the number of APs joined to it. This is usually called a unified or centralized WLC deployment\nTypical unified WLCs can support a maximum of 6000 APs\nA WLC can also be located in a central position in the network, inside a data center in a private cloud, as shown in Figure 27-9. This is known as a cloud-based WLC deployment, where the WLC exists as a virtual machine rather than a physical device.\nSuch a controller can typically support up to 3000 APs.\nFor small campuses or distributed branch locations, where the number of APs is relatively small in each, the WLC can be co-located with a stack of switches, as shown in Figure 27-10. This is known as an embedded WLC deployment\nTypical Cisco embedded WLCs can support up to 200 APs. The APs do not necessarily have to be connected to the switches that host the WLC\nthe WLC function can be co-located with an AP that is installed at the branch site. This is known as a Cisco Mobility Express WLC deployment\nA Mobility Express WLC can support up to 100 APs.\nCisco AP Modes\nWLC, you can also configure a lightweight AP to operate in one of the following special-purpose modes:\nLocal: The default lightweight mode that offers one or more functioning BSSs on a specific channel. During times that it is not transmitting, the AP will scan the other channels to measure the level of noise, measure interference, discover rogue devices, and match against intrusion detection system (IDS) events.\nMonitor: The AP does not transmit at all, but its receiver is enabled to act as a dedicated sensor. The AP checks for IDS events, detects rogue access points, and determines the position of stations through location-based services.\nFlexConnect: An AP at a remote site can locally switch traffic between an SSID and a VLAN if its CAPWAP tunnel to the WLC is down and if it is configured to do so.\nSniffer: An AP dedicates its radios to receiving 802.11 traffic from other sources, much like a sniffer or packet capture device. The captured traffic is then forwarded to a PC running network analyzer software such as Wildpackets OmniPeek or WireShark, where it can be analyzed further.\nRogue detector: An AP dedicates itself to detecting rogue devices by correlating MAC addresses heard on the wired network with those heard over the air. Rogue devices are those that appear on both networks.\nBridge: An AP becomes a dedicated bridge (point-to-point or point-to-multipoint) between two networks. Two APs in bridge mode can be used to link two locations separated by a distance. Multiple APs in bridge mode can form an indoor or outdoor mesh network.\nFlex+Bridge: FlexConnect operation is enabled on a mesh AP.\nSE-Connect: The AP dedicates its radios to spectrum analysis on all wireless channels. You can remotely connect a PC running software such as MetaGeek Chanalyzer or Cisco Spectrum Expert to the AP to collect and analyze the spectrum analysis data to discover sources of interference.\nRemember that a lightweight AP is normally in local mode when it is providing BSSs and allowing client devices to associate to wireless LANs. When an AP is configured to operate in one of the other modes, local mode (and the BSSs) is disabled.",

Usually, the service port is assigned to a management VLAN so that you can access the controller with SSH or a web browser to perform initial configuration or for maintenance. Notice that the service port supports only a single VLAN, so the corresponding switch port must be configured for access mode only.\nControllers also have multiple distribution system ports that you must connect to the network. These ports carry most of the data coming to and going from the controller. For example, the CAPWAP tunnels (control and data) that extend to each of a controller’s APs pass across the distribution system ports. Client data also passes from wireless LANs to wired VLANs over the ports. In addition, any management traffic using a web browser, SSH, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), and so on, normally reaches the controller in-band through the ports.\nthe distribution system ports always operate in 802.1Q trunking mode.\nThe distribution system ports can operate independently, each one transporting multiple VLANs to a unique group of internal controller interfaces. For resiliency, you can configure distribution system ports in redundant pairs. One port is primarily used; if it fails, a backup port is used instead.\nController distribution system ports can be configured as a link aggregation group (LAG) such that they are bundled together to act as one larger link\ntraffic can be load-balanced across the individual ports that make up the LAG\nLAG offers resiliency; if one individual port fails, traffic will be redirected to the remaining working ports instead.\nCisco WLCs do not support any link aggregation negotiation protocol, like LACP or PAgP, at all.\nUsing WLC Interfaces\nthe controller must somehow map those wired VLANs to equivalent logical wireless networks\nVLAN must be connected to a unique wireless LAN that exists on a controller and its associated APs.\nCisco wireless controllers provide the necessary connectivity through internal logical interfaces, which must be configured with an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Each interface is then assigned to a physical port and a VLAN ID. You can think of an interface as a Layer 3 termination on a VLAN.\nCisco controllers support the following interface types:\nManagement interface: Used for normal management traffic, such as RADIUS user authentication, WLC-to-WLC communication, web-based and SSH sessions, SNMP, Network Time Protocol (NTP), syslog, and so on. The management interface is also used to terminate CAPWAP tunnels between the controller and its APs.\nRedundancy management: The management IP address of a redundant WLC that is part of a high availability pair of controllers. The active WLC uses the management interface address, while the standby WLC uses the redundancy management address.\nVirtual interface: IP address facing wireless clients when the controller is relaying client DHCP requests, performing client web authentication, and supporting client mobility.\nService port interface: Bound to the service port and used for out-of-band management.\nDynamic interface: Used to connect a VLAN to a WLAN.\nSwitch VLAN a VLAN n VLAN x VLAN y Dynamic Interface Dynamic Interface Management Redundancy Management Service Port WLC WI-AN 1 WI-AN n SSID SSID\nThe management interface faces the switched network, where management users and APs are located. Management traffic will usually consist of protocols like HTTPS, SSH, SNMP, NTP, TFTP, and so on\nconsists of CAPWAP packets that carry control and data tunnels to and from the APs.\nThe virtual interface is used only for certain client-facing operations.\nwhen a wireless client issues a request to obtain an IP address, the controller can relay the request on to an actual DHCP server that can provide the appropriate IP address\nDHCP server appears to be the controller’s virtual interface address. Clients may see the virtual interface’s address, but that address is never used when the controller communicates with other devices on the switched network.\nBecause the virtual interface is used only for some client management functions, you should configure it with a unique, nonroutable address. For example, you might use 10.1.1.1 because it is within a private address space defined in RFC 1918.\nThe virtual interface address is also used to support client mobility.\nevery controller that exists in the same mobility group should be configured with a virtual address that is identical to the others. By using one common virtual address, all the controllers will appear to operate as a cluster as clients roam from controller to controller.\nDynamic interfaces map WLANs to VLANs,\nmaking the logical connections between wireless and wired networks. You will configure one dynamic interface for each wireless LAN that is offered by the controller’s APs and then map the interface to the WLAN.\nEach dynamic interface must also be configured with its own IP address and can act as a DHCP relay for wireless clients. To filter traffic passing through a dynamic interface, you can configure an optional access list.\nConfiguring a WLAN\n192.16B.199.0/24 WLC Interface Engineering VI-AN 100 192.168.199.199/24 CAPWAP W LAN V LAN\nThe controller will bind the WLAN to one of its interfaces and then push the WLAN configuration out to all of its APs by default.\nLike VLANs, you can use WLANs to segregate wireless users and their traffic into logical networks. Users associated with one WLAN cannot cross over into another one unless their traffic is bridged or routed from one VLAN to another through the wired network infrastructure.\nCisco controllers support a maximum of 512 WLANs, but only 16 of them can be actively configured on an AP.\nAdvertising each WLAN to potential wireless clients uses up valuable airtime.\nEvery AP must broadcast beacon management frames at regular intervals to advertise the existence of a BSS\nBeacons are normally sent 10 times per second, or once every 100 ms, at the lowest mandatory data rate\nif you create too many WLANs, a channel can be starved of any usable airtime\nalways limit the number of WLANs to five or fewer; a maximum of three WLANs is best\nBefore you create a new WLAN, think about the following parameters it will need to have:\nSSID string\nController interface and VLAN number\nType of wireless security needed\nyou will create the appropriate dynamic controller interface to support the new WLAN; then you will enter the necessary WLAN parameters\nStep 1.

Be sure to set the server status to Enabled so that the controller can begin using it. At the bottom of the page, you can select the type of user that will be authenticated with the server.

Create a New WLAN\nselecting WLANs from the top menu bar (displays current WLANs)\nYou can create a new WLAN by selecting Create New from the drop-down menu and then clicking the Go button.\nNext, enter a descriptive name as the profile name and the SSID text string.\nThe ID number is used as an index into the list of WLANs that are defined on the controller. The ID number becomes useful when you use templates in Prime Infrastructure (PI) to configure WLANs on multiple controllers at the same time.\nCISCO KLAN s\nWLAN templates are applied to specific WLAN ID numbers on controllers. The WLAN ID is only locally significant and is not passed between controllers. As a rule, you should keep the sequence of WLAN names and IDs consistent across multiple controllers so that any configuration templates you use in the future will be applied to the same WLANs on each controller.\nClick the Apply button to create the new WLAN.

By default, the management interface is selected. The drop-down list contains all the interface names that are available\nFinally, use the Broadcast SSID check box to select whether the APs should broadcast the SSID name in the beacons they transmit.\nHiding the SSID name, by not broadcasting it, does not really provide any worthwhile security\nConfiguring WLAN Security\nSelect the Security tab to configure the security settings.

In that case, 802.1x and EAP would be used to authenticate wireless clients against one or more RADIUS servers.\nTo specify which servers the WLAN should use, you would select the Security tab and then the AAA Servers tab in the WLAN edit screen. You can identify up to six specific RADIUS servers in the WLAN configuration. Beside each server, select a specific server IP address from the drop-down menu of globally defined servers.

The 802.11 standard calls this a basic service set (BSS). At the heart of every BSS is a wireless access point (AP),\nThe AP operates in infrastructure mode, which means it offers the services that are necessary to form the infrastructure of a wireless network. The AP also establishes its BSS over a single wireless channel. The AP and the members of the BSS must all use the same channel to communicate properly.\nthe operation of a BSS hinges on the AP, the BSS is bounded by the area where the AP’s signal is usable. This is known as the basic service area (BSA) or cell.\nthe cell is shown as a simple shaded circular area that centers around the AP itself.\nIt advertises the existence of the BSS so that devices can find it and try to join. To do that, the AP uses a unique BSS identifier (BSSID) that is based on the AP’s own radio MAC address.\nWireless devices must also have unique MAC addresses to send wireless frames at Layer 2 over the air.\nthe AP advertises the wireless network with a Service Set Identifier (SSID), which is a text string containing a logical name. Think of the BSSID as a machine-readable name tag that uniquely identifies the BSS ambassador (the AP), and the SSID as a nonunique, human-readable name tag that identifies the wireless service.\nMembership with the BSS is called an association. A wireless device must send an association request to the AP and the AP must either grant or deny the request. Once associated, a device becomes a client, or an 802.11 station (STA), of the BSS.\nAs long as a wireless client remains associated with a BSS, most communications to and from the client must pass through the AP,\nBy using the BSSID as a source or destination address, data frames can be relayed to or from the AP.\nSSID. • ‘MyNetwork\" BSSID: “\u003e\nBy sending data through the AP first, the BSS remains stable and under control.\nDistribution System\nThe 802.11 standard refers to the upstream wired Ethernet as the distribution system (DS) for the wireless BSS,\nthe AP is in charge of mapping a virtual local-area network (VLAN) to an SSID.\nSSID. \" • MyNetwork\" BSS BSSID:\nThe AP must be connected to the switch by a trunk link that carries the VLANs.\nThe AP uses the 802.1Q tag to map the VLAN numbers to the appropriate SSIDs.\nVLANs 10, 20, 30 SSID: ‘MyNetwork\" SSID: \"YourNetwork\" BSSID: SSID: ‘Guest\" BSSID: BSSID: F igure 26-7 Supporting Multiple SSIDs on One AP “\u003e\nThe AP then appears as multiple logical APs—one per BSS—with a unique BSSID for each. With Cisco APs, this is usually accomplished by incrementing the last digit of the radio’s MAC address for each SSID.\nEven though wireless clients can be distributed across many SSIDs, all of those clients must share the same AP’s hardware and must contend for airtime on the same channel.\nExtended Service Set\nWhen APs are placed at different geographic locations, they can all be interconnected by a switched infrastructure. The 802.11 standard calls this an extended service set (ESS),\nIdeally, any SSIDs that are defined on one AP should be defined on all the APs in an ESS\nBSS-I AP-I BSSID: SSID: \" My Network\" BSS-2 AP-2 BSSID: SSID: \"MyNetwork\"\nPassing from one AP to another is called roaming\nEach AP offers its own BSS on its own channel, to prevent interference between the APs. As a client device roams from one AP to another, it must scan the available channels to find a new AP (and BSS) to roam toward.\nIndependent Basic Service Set\nThe 802.11 standard allows two or more wireless clients to communicate directly with each other, with no other means of network connectivity. This is known as an ad hoc wireless network, or an independent basic service set (IBSS),\nOne of the devices must take the lead and begin advertising a network name and the necessary radio parameters, much like an AP would do.\nOther Wireless Topologies\nRepeater\nA wireless repeater takes the signal it receives and repeats or retransmits it in a new cell area around the repeater.\nClient A Repeater Client B “\u003e\nSome repeaters can use two transmitters and receivers to keep the original and repeated signals isolated on different channels. One transmitter and receiver pair is dedicated to signals in the AP’s cell, while the other pair is dedicated to signals in the repeater’s own cell.\nWorkgroup Bridge\nWGB acts as an external wireless network adapter for a device that has none.\nClient A WGB Cliente\nYou might encounter two types of workgroup bridges:\nUniversal workgroup bridge (uWGB): A single wired device can be bridged to a wireless network.\nWorkgroup bridge (WGB): A Cisco-proprietary implementation that allows multiple wired devices to be bridged to a wireless network.\nOutdoor Bridge\nact as a bridge to form a single wireless link from one LAN to another over a long distance.\nOne AP configured in bridge mode is needed on each end of the wireless link. Special purpose antennas are normally used with the bridges to focus their signals in one direction\nBridge LAN В “\u003e\nA point-to-multipoint bridged link allows a central site to be bridged to several other sites\n00 V NVI “\u003e\nMesh Network\nIn a mesh topology, wireless traffic is bridged from AP to AP, in a daisy-chain fashion, using another wireless channel.\nMesh APs can leverage dual radios—one using a channel in one range of frequencies and one a different range. Each mesh AP usually maintains a BSS on one channel, with which wireless clients can associate. Client traffic is then usually bridged from AP to AP over other channels as a backhaul network.\nThe mesh network runs its own dynamic routing protocol to work out the best path for backhaul traffic to take across the mesh APs.\nRF Overview\nElectromagnetic waves do not travel in a straight line. Instead, they travel by expanding in all directions away from the antenna.\nfrequency of the wave, or the number of times the signal makes one complete up and down cycle in 1 second\n1 Second Frequency = 4 cycles/second = 4 Hertz\nA hertz (Hz) is the most commonly used frequency unit and is nothing other than one cycle per second.\nUnit Hertz Kilohertz Megahertz Gigahertz Abbreviation kHz MHz GHz Meaning Cycles per second 1000 Hz “\u003e\n3 kHz to 300 GHz is commonly called radio frequency (RF).\nWireless Bands and Channels\nBecause a range of frequencies might be used for the same purpose, it is customary to refer to the range as a band of frequencies.\nthe range from 530 kHz to around 1710 kHz is used by AM radio stations; therefore, it is commonly called the AM band or the AM broadcast band.\nOne of the two main frequency ranges used for wireless LAN communication lies between 2.400 and 2.4835 GHz. This is usually called the 2.4-GHz band, even though it does not encompass the entire range between 2.4 and 2.5 GHz\nThe other wireless LAN range is usually called the 5-GHz band because it lies between 5.150 and 5.825 GHz. The 5-GHz band actually contains the following four separate and distinct bands:\n5.150 to 5.250 GHz\n5.250 to 5.350 GHz\n5.470 to 5.725 GHz\n5.725 to 5.825 GHz\nGap between 5.350 and 5.470\nthis gap exists and cannot be used for wireless LANs.\nDo not worry about memorizing the band names or exact frequency ranges; just be aware of the two main bands at 2.4 and 5 GHz.\nA frequency band contains a continuous range of frequencies.\nbands are usually divided into a number of distinct channels. Each channel is known by a channel number and is assigned to a specific frequency.\n2.412 2.417 2.422 2427 6 2432 2437 2.442 Dsss: 22 MHz OFDM: 20 MHz 2.44? 2,452 2457 11 2462 2467 2.472 2484\nChannel U-Nll-2 U-Nll-2 Extended 112 116 124 128132 136 140 5.700 U-Nll-3 149153157161 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 GHz 5180 5240 5260 5.320 5.745 5825 “\u003e\nIn the 5-GHz band, this is the case because each channel is allocated a frequency range that does not encroach on or overlap the frequencies allocated for any other channel. In other words, the 5-GHz band consists of nonoverlapping channels.\nAPs and Wireless Standards\nAmend- ment 802.11- 1997 802.11b 802.118 802.11a 802.11n 802.11ac 802.11ax 2.4 GHz Yes Yes Yes No Yes No Yes GHz No No No Yes Yes Yes Yes Max Data Rate 2 Mbps 11 Mbps 54 Mbps 54 Mbps 600 Mbps 6.93 Gbps 4x 802.11ac Notes The original 802.11 standard rati- fied in 1997 Introduced in 1999 Introduced in 2003 Introduced in 1999 HT (high throughput), introduced in 2009 VHT (very high throughput), in- troduced in 2013 High Efficiency Wireless, Wi-Fi6; expected late 2019; will operate on other bands too, as they be- come available “\u003e\nWireless client devices and APs can be compatible with one or more amendments;\nAPs can usually operate on both bands simultaneously to support any clients that might be present on each band.\nwireless clients typically associate with an AP on one band at a time, while scanning for potential APs on both bands. The band used to connect to an AP is chosen according to the operating system, wireless adapter driver, and other internal configuration.\nCisco APs have dual radios (sets of transmitters and receivers) to support BSSs on one 2.4-GHz channel and other BSSs on one 5-GHz channel simultaneously. Some models also have two 5-GHz radios that can be configured to operate BSSs on two different channels at the same time, providing wireless coverage to higher densities of users that are located in the same vicinity.\nRF signals propagate or reach further on the 2.4-GHz band than on the 5-GHz band. They also tend to penetrate indoor walls and objects easier at 2.4 GHz than 5 GHz. However, the 2.4-GHz band is commonly more crowded with wireless devices. Remember that only three nonoverlapping channels are available, so the chances of other neighboring APs using the same channels is greater. In contrast, the 5-GHz band has many more channels available to use, making channels less crowded and experiencing less interference.",

You will want to make a CNAME record for your nextcloud subdomain.\nJust add “nextcloud” as the name and “yourwebsite.com” as the content. This will make it so “nextcloud.yourwebsite.com”.

Here is a guide on troubleshooting with occ. The basic command is as follows:\nsudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occAdd this as an alias in ~/.bashrc for ease of use.\nYou are ready to log in to Nextcloud! Go to your nextcloud domain in a browser. In my case, I head to nextcloud.perfectdarkmode.com. Fill out the form to create your first Nextcloud user:\nChoose an admin username and secure password. Leave Data folder as the default value. For Database user, enter the user you set for the SQL database. For Database password, enter the password you chose for the new user in MariaDB. For Database name, enter: nextcloud Leave “localhost” as “localhost”. Click Finish. Now that you are signed in. Here are a few things you can do to start you off:\nDownload the desktop and mobile app and sync all of your data. (covered below) Look at different apps to consolodate your programs all in one place. Put the Nextcloud dashboard as your default browser homepage and customize themes. Set up email integration. NextCloud desktop synchronization Install the desktop client (Fedora)\nSudo dnf install nextcloudclientInstall on other distros: https://help.nextcloud.com/t/install-nextcloud-client-for-opensuse-arch-linux-fedora-ubuntu-based-android-ios/13657\nRun the nextcloud desktop app and sign in. Choose folders to sync. Folder will be ~/Nextcloud. Move everything into your nextcloud folder. This may break things with filepaths so beware. Now you are ready to use and explore nextcloud. Here is a video from TechHut to get you started down the NextCloud rabbit hole.\nChange max upload size (default is 500mg) /var/www/nextcloud/.user.ini php_value upload_max_filesize = 16G php_value post_max_size = 16G\nRemove file locks Put Nextcloud in maintenance mode: Edit config/config.php and change this line:\n'maintenance' =\u003e true,\nEmpty table oc_file_locks: Use tools such as phpmyadmin or connect directly to your database and run (the default table prefix is oc_, this prefix can be different or even empty):\nDELETE FROM oc_file_locks WHERE 1\ndisable maintenance mode (undo first step).

You can revert back to any previous commit. Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit! Files in your Git repository folder can be in one of 2 states: Tracked - files that Git knows about and are added to the repository Untracked - files that are in your working directory, but not added to the repository When you first add files to an empty repository, they are all untracked. To get Git to track them, you need to stage them, or add them to the staging environment.\nGit Staging Environment Staged files are files that are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on.\nGit Commit Adding commits keep track of changes. Each commit is a change point or “save point”. You can (and should) include a message with each commit.\n$ git commit\n$ git commit -m \"add comment here\" * commit and add a comment * -m flag adds a message\n$ git commit -a -m \"add message here\" * -a flag automatically stage every changed, already tracked file\nCommit without stage -a option will automatically stage every changed, already tracked file. Can make you commit unwanted changes Git Branch Branch = A new/separate version of the main repository. allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch. a branch can be merged with the main project. switch between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other.

Git is not the same as GitHub. GitHub makes tools that use Git. GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018. Git Merge Combine work from two different branches. Creates a special commit with two parents $ git merge branch-name - makes a new commit with two parent (Main and the chosen branch) - Doesn’t merge the branch unless you check out the branch first.\n$ git checkout branch-name; git merge main - checkout branch and merge with main\nGit Rebase Another way of combining work between branches Takes a set of commits and copies them to somewhere else can be used to make a nice linear sequence of commits. commit log / history of the repository will be a lot cleaner if only rebasing is allowed. moves th $ git rebase main - adds selected branch as a commit over main $ git rebase branch-name - You will also need to checkout main and rebase it to the last commit\nHEAD the symbolic name for the currently checked out commit always points to the most recent commit Detaching head attaching head to a commit instead of a branch $ git checkout commit-name - checks out the commit and attaches the head",

    "content": "Word Press is great, but it is probably a lot more bloated then you need for a personal website. Enter Hugo, it has less server capacity and storage needs than Word Press. Hugo is a static site generator than takes markdown files and converts them to html.\nHosting your own website is also a lot cheaper than having a provider like Bluehost do it for you. Instead of $15 per month, I am currently paying $10 per year.\nThis guide will walk through building a website step-by-step.\nSetting up a Virtual Private Server (VPS) Registering a domain name Pointing the domain to your server Setting up hugo on your local PC Syncing your Hugo generate site with your server Using nginx to serve your site Enable http over SSL Setting up a Virtual Private Server (VPS) I use Vultr as my VPS. When I signed up they had a $250 credit towards a new account. If you select the cheapest server (you shouldn’t need anything else for a basic site) that comes out to about $6 a month. Of course the $250 credit goes towards that which equates to around 41 months free.\nHead to vultr.com. Create and account and Select the Cloud Compute option.\nUnder CPU \u0026 Storage Technology, select “Regular Performance”. Then under “Server Location, select the server closest to you. Or closest to where you think your main audience will be.\nUnder Server image, select the OS you are most comfortable with. This guide uses Debian.\nUnder Server Size, slect the 10GB SSD. Do not select the “IPv6 ONLY” option. Leave the other options as default and enter your server hostname.\nOn the products page, click your new server. You can find your server credentials and IPv4 address here. You will need these to log in to your server.\nLog into your sever via ssh to test. From a Linux terminal run:\nssh username@serveripaddressThen, enter your password when prompted.\nRegistering a Domain Name I got my domain perfectdarkmode.com from Cloudflare.com for about $10 per year. You can check to see available domains there. You can also check https://www.namecheckr.com/ to see iof that name is available on various social media sites.\nIn CloudFlare, just click “add a site” and pick a domain that works for you. Next, you will need your server address from earlier.\nUnder domain Registration, click “Manage Domains”, click “manage” on your domain. One the sidebar to the right, there is a qucik actions menu. Click “update DNS configuration”.\nClick “Add record”. Type is an “A” record. Enter the name and the ip address that you used earlier for your server. Uncheck “Proxy Status” and save.\nYou can check to see if your DNS has updated on various DNS severs at https://dnschecker.org/. Once those are up to date (after a couple minutes) you should be able to ping your new domain.\n[davidthomas@fedora posts]$ ping perfectdarkmode.com PING perfectdarkmode.com (104.238.140.131) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 104.238.140.131.vultrusercontent.com (104.238.140.131): icmp_seq=1 ttl=53 time=33.2 ms 64 bytes from 104.238.140.131.vultrusercontent.com (104.238.140.131): icmp_seq=2 ttl=53 time=28.2 ms 64 bytes from 104.238.140.131.vultrusercontent.com (104.238.140.131): icmp_seq=3 ttl=53 time=31.0 msNow, you can use the same ssh command to ssh into your vultr serverusing your domain name.\nssh username@domain.comSetting up hugo on your local PC Hugo is a popular open-source static site generator. It allows you to take markdown files, and builds them into and html website. To start go to https://gohugo.io/installation/ and download Hugo on your local computer. (I will show you how to upload the site to your server later.)\nPick a theme The theme I use is here https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/\nYou can browse your own themes as well. Just make sure to follow the installation instructions. Let’s create a new Hugo site. Change into the directory where you want your site to be located in. Mine rests in ~/Documents/.\ncd ~/Documents/Create your new Hugo site.\nhugo new site site-nameThis will make a new folder with your site name in the ~/Documents directory. This folder will have a few directories and a config file in it.\narchetypes config.toml content data layouts public resources static themesFor this tutorial, we will be working with the config.toml file and the content, public, static, and themes. Next, load the theme into your site directory. For the Hello Friend NG theme:\ngit clone https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git themes/hello-friend-ngNow we will load the example site into our working site. Say yes to overwrite.\ncp -a themes/hello-friend-ng/exampleSite/* .The top of your new config.toml site now contains:\nbaseURL = \"https://example.com\" title = \"Hello Friend NG\" languageCode = \"en-us\" theme = \"hello-friend-ng\"Replace your baseURL with your site name and give your site a title. Set the enableGlobalLanguageMenu option to false if you want to remove the language swithcer option at the top. I also set enableThemeToggle to true so users could set the theme to dark or light.\nYou can also fill in the links to your social handles. Comment out any lines you don’t want with a “#” like so:\n[params.social](params.social) name = \"twitter\" url = \"https://twitter.com/\" [params.social](params.social) name = \"email\" url = \"mailto:nobody@example.com\" [params.social](params.social) name = \"github\" url = \"https://github.com/\" [params.social](params.social) name = \"linkedin\" url = \"https://www.linkedin.com/\" # [params.social](params.social) # name = \"stackoverflow\" # url = \"https://www.stackoverflow.com/\"You may also want to edit the footer text to your liking. I commented out the second line that comes with the example site:\n[params.footer] trademark = true rss = true copyright = true author = true topText = [] bottomText = [ # \"Powered by \u003ca href=\\\"http://gohugo.io\\\"\u003eHugo\u003c/a\u003e\", # \"Made with \u0026#10084; by \u003ca href=\\\"https://github.com/rhazdon\\\"\u003eDjordje Atlialp\u003c/a\u003e\" ]Now, move the contents of the example contents folder over to your site’s contents folder (giggidy):\ncp -r ~/Documents/hugo/themes/hello-friend-ng/exampleSite/content/* ~/Documents/hugo/content/Let’s clean up a little bit. Cd into ~/Documents/hugo/content/posts. Rename the file to the name of your first post. Also, delete all of the other files here:\ncd ~/Documents/hugo/contents/posts mv goisforlovers.md newpostnamehere.md find . ! -name 'newpostnamehere.md' -type f -exec rm -f {} +Open the new post file and delete everything after this:\n+++ title = \"Building a Minimalist Website with Hugo\" description = \"\" type = [\"posts\",\"post\"] tags = [ \"hugo\", \"nginx\", \"ssl\", \"http\", \"vultr\", ] date = \"2023-03-26\" categories = [ \"tools\", \"linux\", ] series = [\"tools\"] [ author ] name = \"David Thomas\" +++You will need to fill out this header information for each new post you make. This will allow you to give your site a title, tags, date, categories, etc. This is what is called a TOML header. TOML stands for Tom’s Obvious Minimal Language. Which is a minimal language used for parsing data. Hugo uses TOML to fill out your site.\nSave your doc and exit. Next, there should be an about.md page now in your ~/Documents/hugo/Contents folder. Edit this to edit your about page for your site. You can use this Markdown Guide if you need help learning markdown language. https://www.markdownguide.org/\nNote: To insert an image into your post. Add the image to your ~/Documents/hugo/static directory. Then reference the image in your post like this:\nServe your website locally Let’s test the website by serving it locally and accessing it at localhost:1313 in your web browser. Enter the command:\nhugo serveHugo will now be generating your website. You can view it by entering localhost:1313 in your webbrowser.\nYou can use this to test new changes before uploading them to your server. When you svae a post or page file such as your about page, hugo will automatically update the changes to this local page if the local server is running.\nPress “Ctrl + c” to stop this local server. This is only for testing and does not need to be running to make your site work.\nBuild out your public directory Okay, your website is working locally, how do we get it to your server to host it online? We are almost there. First, we will use the hugo command to build opur website in the public folder. Then, we will make a copy of our public folder on our server using rsync. I will also show you how to create an alias so you do not have to remember the rsync command every time.\nFrom your hugo site folder run:\n[davidthomas@fedora hugo]$ hugo Start building sites … hugo v0.98.0+extended linux/amd64 BuildDate=unknown | EN -------------------+----- Pages | 30 Paginator pages | 0 Non-page files | 0 Static files | 16 Processed images | 0 Aliases | 15 Sitemaps | 1 Cleaned | 0 Total in 65 msNext, we will put your public hugo folder into /var/www/ on your server. Here is how to do that with an alias. Open ~/.bashrc.\nvim ~/.bashrcAdd the following line to the end of the file, making sure to replace the username and server name:\n# My custom aliases alias rsyncp='rsync -rtvzP ~/Documents/hugo/public/ username@myserver.com:/var/www/public'Save and exit the file. Then tell bash to update it’s source config file.\nsource ~/.bashrcNow your can run the command by just using the new alias any time. Your will need to do this every time you update your site locally.\nrsyncpSet up nginx on your server Install nginx\napt update apt upgrade apt install nginxcreate an nginx config file in /etc/nginx/sites-available/\nvim /etc/nginx/sites-available/publicYou will need to add the following to the file, update the options, then save and exit:\nserver { listen 80 ; listen [::]:80 ; server_name example.org ; root /var/www/mysite ; index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html ; location / { try_files $uri $uri/ =404 ; } }Enter your domain in “server_name” line in place of “example.org”. Also, point “root” to your new site file from earlier. (/var/www/public). Then save and exit.\nLink this site-available config file to sites-enabled to enable it. Then restart nginx:\nln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/public /etc/nginx/sites-enabled systemctl reload nginxAccess Permissions We will need to make sure nginx has permissions to your site folder so that it can access them to serve your site. Run:\nchmod 777 /var/www/publicFirewall Permissions You will need to make sure your firewall allows port 80 and 443. Vultr installs the ufw program by default. But your can install it if you used a different provider. Beware, enabling a firewalll could block you from accessing your vm, so do your research before tinkering outside of these instructions.\nufw allow 80 ufw allow 443Nginx Security We will want to hide your nginx version number on error pages. This will make your site a bit harder for hackers to find exploits. Open your Nginx config file at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and remove the “#” before “server_tokens off;”\nEnter your domain into your browser. Congrats! You now have a running website!\nUse Certbot to enable HTTPS Right now, our site uses the unencrypted http. We want it to use the encrypted version HTTPS (HTTP over SSL). This will increase user privacy, hide usernames and passwords used on your site, and you get the lock symbol by your URL name instead of “!not secure”.\nInstall Certbot and It’s Nginx Module apt install python3-certbot-nginxRun certbot certbot --nginxFill out the information, certbot asks for your emaill so it can send you a reminder when the certs need to be renewed every 3 months. You do not need to consent to giving your email to the EFF. Press 1 to select your domain. And 2 too redirect all connections to HTTPS.\nCertbot will build out some information in your site’s config file. Refresh your site. You should see your new fancy lock icon.\nSet Up a Cronjob to automatically Renew certbot certs crontab -eSelect a text editor and add this line to the end of the file. Then save and exit the file:\n0 0 1 * * certbot --nginx renewYou now have a running website. Just make new posts locally, the run “hugo” to rebuild the site. And use the rsync alias to update the folder on your server. I will soon be making tutorials on making an email address for your domain, such as david@perfectdarkmode.com on my site. I will also be adding a comments section, RSS feed, email subscription, sidebar, and more.\nFeel free to reach out with any questions if you get stuck. This is meant to be an all encompassing guide. So I want it to work.\nExtras Optimizing images Create assets folder in main directory.\nCreate images folder in /assets\nAccess image using hugo pipes\n{{ $image := resources.Get \"images/test-image.jpg\" }} \u003cimg src=\"{{ ( $image.Resize \"500x\" ).RelPermalink }}\" /\u003ehttps://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/",

    "content": "The 3 jobs for you as a parent Control obnoxious Behavior (STOP behaviors) Encourage good behavior (START behaviors) Strengthening your relationship with your children Controlling obnoxious behavior (STOP Behaviors) This is where counting and break times come in. You will use counting and break times for STOP behaviors.\nTaking Breaks and Counting A break is when parents and child can separate briefly so they can calm down and regroup. You do not talk about the behavior after the break. No need to punish the child twice. If the behavior was dangerous, unusual, or new, then give a brief explanation.\n3 counts are needed before a break occurs. And after you’ve tried ignoring, sympathetic listening, distraction, and joint problem solving.\nYou and your child may fall for the arguing/ yelling/ hitting/ persuading/ defending/ rationalizing trap. You need to start counting before this happens. Once you notice that you’ve fallen in this trap. Simply go back to counting.\nThe parents tone should not be anger/ negative. It should simply be “I love you but you simply cannot behave this way”.\nStraight to 3! Major behavior goes straight to 3 and taking a break. This is stuff like hitting, spitting, etc. Still, you must be gentle and consistent. Then the child’s behavior will mature over time.\nYour child won’t behave rationally when they are upset. Same goes to you! The brain is just not wired that way. When dealing with a child, you must manage the yelling/ screaming/ whining/ fighting. All while encouraging positive behaviors like eating, doing homework, cleaning up, going to bed and child/parent bonding.\nTo be an effective parent you must be gentle and friendly. The message your child receives should be that you love them and will take care of them.\nYou must also balance this with being firm and letting them know that you expect them to do something.\nChildren also will model your behavior. Like if you solve problems with anger. They will to. If you are calm and collected. They will learn that from you as well.\nCounting is for STOP behaviors You must control negative behaviors. These are things you want your children to STOP doing. And what you will use COUNTING for.\nPhysical attacks on people , breaking something, fighting\nTeasing\nWhining\nTemper (intimidation, “I HATE YOU!”)\nArguing\nBadgering (wearing you down with repetition\nTantrums\nYelling\nThreat (I’m running away from home)\nMartyrdom (“I never get anything”)\nCrying, pouting, looking sad on purpose\nSaying something is unfair\nButter up “you are the nicest dad in the world!”\nPromises/ insincere apologies\nThis is controlling obnoxious behavior. Or the demanding side of parenting. This teaches you and your child to hold back and avoid dysfunctional responses.\nMethods for stop behaviors\nCounting Go straight to 3 if behavior is dangerous or extreme Don’t talk or get angry, just count Voice should be casual but stern No extra talking or emotion Things should go back to normal after a count Counting with anger is challenging your child to misbehave Both parents can be involved in any of the counts (mom says 1 for first offense dad says 2, etc.) Keep quit and ignore for minor offenses (depending on your fuse) When in doubt count Take about 5 seconds between counts Start the counting cycle over longer as the child gets older. (15 minutes for 5 year old, 2-3 hours for an 11 year old, etc. Do not punish bad grades, use the reward system for grades instead. Explain to child the counting process when you first start. Should not be used for bedtime Break time One minute per year of the child’s life Do not make eye contact or talk to child Remain gentle but firm and instructive You do not have to close the door No lectures, explanations, or emotions after a break time Explanations are appropriate when the behavior is new, unusual, or dangerous Very gentle procedure to calm everyone down If child behaves, praise him and enjoy his company, if they do something else that is countable, count it. Parent should not be furious, yelling, lecturing, or physical or emotionally abusive Most failures are because the parent forgets the no talking and no emotion rules Timer doesn’t start until child is done with tantrum (unless they are 3 or younger, then just let them out when their time is up, start the count over if they continue to misbehave after they get out) Child can go to room and read, take a nap, play legos, draw, etc. No phone, no friends, and no electronic entertainment. Use same strategy if company is over Send kid and friend outside if they both get counted to 3 Give child a hug after break time if they want one. Should happen right when the offense happens. Do not give a break time an hour later for something. If you can’t give a breaktime right away then use a breaktime alternative. What if kids won’t go to break time?\nBring them to the room Choose a breaktime Alternative (you can give them a choice between a couple consequences, you pick if they won’t) Reverse break time, you leave the room, walk around the house, don’t talk If they won’t come out of breaktime, that is okay, just tell them when their time is up What if they leave their room?\nAdd extra time Switch to break time alternative Doorknob cover Locking the door Tell them if they come out then the door gets closed Break Time Alternatives Make sure these are fair and reasonable. And that the punishment fits the behavior.\nLoss of privilege or toy for a period of time bedtime fifteen minutes earlier forty cents off the allowance no electronic entertainment for two hours Earlier bedtime No dessert or treat No use of phone No friend over No conversation—fifteen minutes Removal of DVD, iPod Reduced computer time Loss of TV for evening Loss of electronic games—two hours Monetary fine Small chore—wash bathroom sink Larger chore—weed yard Write a paragraph (Limited only by your imagination) Child has a fit when dropping off at daycare.\nBecome master of the quick exit. Kiss goodbye, tell them when you’ll see them again, and get out of there. The more you talk, the worse you will make the situation.\nSibling rivalry\nnever ask “what happened?”\nCount both kids\nPut them in different breaktime locations\ntantrums\nnever talk or argue with a tantruming child\nCommon mistakes when dealing with a misbehaving child Mistake #1\nusing counting for Start behavior (for example, counting a child to get her to do her homework).\nMistake # 2\nToo much talking\nMistake #3\nToo much emotion\nEncourage good behavior. (START behaviors) This takes more effort on the parent AND the child. Cleaning up after themselves going to bed on time being polite doing homework Warm and demanding side of parenting.\nYou do not count for these things. Instead, to encourage positive action, pick something from this list of methods. You can use one or a combination of these:\nPraise\nTimers\nNatural Consequences\nDocking\nCharting\nCounting variation\nSimple requests\nModel behavior yourself\nMake activity fun or add diversions or friendly challenges\nPositive reinforcement\nCheering and applauding, praise\nElaborate for younger kids, heartfelt for older kids\nPraise in front of other people\nUnexpected praise\nThree positive comments for every negative comment\nSimple requests\n“It’s time to start your homework”\nPhrasing requests in a “matter of fact” tone\nTry not to spring requests out of the blue, give them some warning\nstructure tasks into fixed routines\nKitchen timers\nThe docking system\nif you don’t work, you don’t get paid\nCharge them money for doing their chores\nNatural consequences\nlet the big bad world teach lessons for you\n“I’m sure you’ll do better next time!” (offer encouragement)\nCharting\n3-4 things to work on at one time for a chart\nIf they do good at something on a chart for a long period of time then replace it with something new\nOffer rewards for completing a chart\ntrip for icecream\ntokens\nsmall toy\nrent a game\nouting with parent\nshopping trip\nsleepover\ngame with parent\nno-chore voucher\ncamping in the backyard card for a colelction tech time breakfast in bed cash rent a movie grab-bag surprise comic book or magazine friend over for supper choice of three reinforcers reading a story with parents sleeping with the dog or cat special phone call collection items helping make and eat cookies using a power tool staying up an extra 15 minutes Counting Variation\nFor start behaviors that only take a couple minutes to accomplish\nChildren’s approximate capacities at different ages for doing independent school work:\nAge 6: 10 minutes\nAge 7: 20 minutes\nAge 8: 30 minutes\nAge 9: 40 minutes\nStrengthening your relationship with your children Make sure screen time does not replace face-to-face time You value enjoying each other’s company critical for family well-being and child’s self-esteem that you like them and not just love them.

    "content": "I started reading non-fiction after hitting my rock bottom. I found people to look up to and saw that they were reading and learning constantly to better themselves. This inspired me to develop a reading and self improvement habit that I have continued for more than 10 years.\nNo single book has the ability to change your life. But the things you do, good or bad, over time, compound to extraordinary changes.\nHere are some things that have stuck with me. (In no particular order)\n1. Become interested in other people. Once you start to see things from someone else’s view. You will have more empathy for other people. Connecting with others is what life is all about. You will not be successful in life or business without this.\n2. The safe route comes with a lot of risk. Go to college. Add to your 401k. Work a 9-5 until you are 65. This seems like the safer route. But there are a lot of risks in taking the normal path.\n3. Personal development is the best way to save a relationship. You can’t change other people. Start by reading non fictions books to discover solutions to your problems. Get your body in order. Your finances in check. Take control of your health. Start dressing nice around the house. Check in to life.\n4. Feeding into sexual instincts makes you crave novelty. Your animal self wants to mate with a variety of partners. When you reach sexual satisfaction, a cascade of events starts happening that turns you away from your partner. And make you crave novelty. If not a new partner, then some other stimulus to chase.\n5. Beat procrastination by just doing the thing. There is no answer to “How do I start?” or “What do I do next?”. You just need to clear the way for your brain to do it’s job. Open up your canvas and just begin.\n6. Leaning into pain will set you free. We are constantly running from pain and towards pleasure. In order to maintain homeostasis, your body will build tolerance and your pain/ pleasure set points will get all jacked up. Doing hard things is the only way to reset this balance.\n7. Just be happy. We can spend years seeking for answers, wanting and craving more, being unhappy with our situation. They day will never come when things are just right. Let go and just decide to be happy.\n8. Take ownership of EVERYTHING. There is no point of blaming others. To be a leader, you need to own everything. Even stuff that is not your fault.\n9. Your mind is very good at getting things to happen that you want to happen. Once you get out of your own way, you can accomplish great things. Do not underestimate your ability to figure things out.\n10. Train your brain to focus by doing less. Your ability to focus is greatly effected by your ability to let things go. Less is more in this case.\n11. Set your goals over 3 months instead of yearly. It’s almost impossible to plan effectively over a year. There are too many unknowns that can happen. Set shorter term goals and you will be able to plan down to the nitty-gritty details.\n12. You can train a dog to do anything without being a dick. A lot of people think you have to be mean to dogs in order to bend them to your will. Turns out, dogs will endure pain to get rewards. So not only is this ineffective, it’s downright bad for you and your dog. Have some compassion. Don’t be lazy. Do it the right way.\n13. People have lived through some shitty situations. Digging into history will give you some serious perspective. You don’t have to look far to see just how easy you have it. This perspective is essential.\n14. You are the only one your kids can depend on. They constantly test you to make sure you will never abandon them. Your child needs to know that you love them no matter what. Of course you love them but they do not always see it depending on how you act as a parent. Have compassion. You are on their team.\n15. Religion is a plague on Humanity. Belief is the most powerful force. Even more powerful than time. By default, people act according to their beliefs. And will do bad or stupid things without a second thought. We need to abandon this and be okay with not knowing.\n16. Humans treat animals very poorly. How do we have compassion for an insect or even plants in some cases? But we turn a blind eye on industries that experiment, torture, and kill animals with such great complexity? If you had a pet monkey, mouse, cow, chicken, pig, sheep, etc., you would bond with these animals and go through great lengths to make them happy and comfortable.\nIs it cognitive dissonance? Fear of finding out the truth? Compassion is the most manly thing ever.\n17. Don’t focus on what you can’t control. We spend a great deal of energy and time worrying about the future or regretting the past. Start to filter out things that you have no control over. And lean into the things you can control. You will be much happier.\n18. Do hard things to immunize yourself for when hard things happen. We live comfortable lives. But things won’t always be that way. Probably for anyone. Find something hard to do. Or give up something you enjoy. Even just for a day. And when the time comes to face adversity, you will be a little bit more prepared then if you never left your comfort zone in the first place.\n19. We may not have as much Free Will as we think. Imagine Osama Bin Laden’s son becoming anything other than what he is. When and where you were born. Who you were raised by. And life circumstances greatly impact who you are, the way you think, and how you behave. We aren’t in as much control as we think.\nBut all is not lost. Understanding this will give you compassion not just for others, but for your own shortcomings as well.\nIf you made it this far… Please consider giving me some feedback. I want to become a better writer and help others grow along with me. Feedback is invaluable for this goal.\nThanks for reading!",

    "content": " Date Read: 2024-04-22. How Strongly I Recommend It: 10/10\nGo to the Amazon page for details and reviews.\nThis was a very insightful book. Knowing the balance between pain and pleasure is essential to living in modern day society. Where scarcity is no longer an issue. Our brains are not adapted for a world of abundance. So the forces that kept us alive for thousands of years, are now making us miserable. Consider this a primer into understanding addiction and over consumption. And steps you can take to mitigate this.\nBeing sick and tired is a result of a skewed pain/pleasure balance. In order to find balance, you must understand the relationship between pleasure and pain in the body. Pleasure and pain operate in the same area of the brain and are intertwined.\nCompulsive consumption leads to pain. And we all can face consumption issues. Even if we have good lives.\nThere are many factors that increase risk for over consumption and addiction. These include:\nBiology Mental illness Trauma Genetics Poverty “Limbic capitalism” is the market force that profits on consumption. This provides access hyper novel and more potent substances and behaviors. More than any time in history.\nEven the internet suggests behaviors that we would have not thought of doing in the first place. Porn and TikTok come to mind. We see crazy behaviors as “Normal” because other people on the internet are doing them.\nThe rush is never as good as you imagine.\nKids these days are growing up in padded environments and not ready for the real world. We have made them afraid of adversity and are encouraging hedonism and escapism.\nWe can’t even put up with minor discomforts like being bored. We are always seeking out novelty and entertainment.\nGo 30 minutes a day with nothing but your thoughts. This will help you become familiar with yourself, others, and the world. You are no longer running from painful thoughts and emotions.\nBoredom can be terrifying. It makes you think about big issues, meaning, and purpose. Boredom is an opportunity. You may discover something new. It gives your mind space to think.\nYou may attribute fatigue and the inability to focus to mental illness. But it could also be from sleep deprivation, over consumption, and over stimulation.\nThe reason we are so miserable is because we are trying so hard not to be miserable.\nWhy too much pleasure leads to pain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in reward processing. It plays a bigger role in the motivation to get a reward than the pleasure of having the reward.\nThe brains reward pathway includes these parts of the brain:\nVentral tegmental Nucleus accumbens Prefrontal cortex The more/faster dopamine released from a drug or behavior, the more addictive the drug or behavior is.\nPleasure and pain function as a balance in the brain. When one side of the balance is weighted down, the brain compensates by pushing down on the opposite side. Pleasure leads to pain, pain leads to pleasure.\nThe brain wants to maintain homeostasis.\nOpponent process theory states that any prolonged or repeated departures from hedonic or effective neutrality have a cost.\nWith prolonged exposure to pleasure, our capacity to tolerate pain decreases, and our threshold for experiencing pleasure increases.\nThe negative feedback caused by tolerance Repeated exposure to a pleasure stimulus makes the pleasure from that stimulus less and less. And the rebound to the pain side gets stronger and longer. You need more of a behavior or substance over time to feel the same amount of pleasure.\nOver time, your baseline gets set to the side of pain, as your brain tries to counteract bigger and more potent doses of pleasure. See how this bird starts out normal and healthy, then eventually needs it’s drug just to feel normal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUngLgGRJpo\nPeople who do Opioids for a long time often experience more pain not less. This is referred to as “opioid induced hyperglasia”.\nHeavy and prolonged dopamine leads to a baseline that is dopamine deficient. Hedonism leads to ahedonia.\nUniversal symtoms of withdrawl include:\nAnxiety Irritability Insomnia Dysphoria The pain from withdrawl is what drives people to relapse, withdrawl is the pleasure/pain balance tipping towards the side of pain.\nIf you wait long enough, you can reset your dopamine baseline. (in most cases) And you can regain pleasure in simple things like going for walks, listening to birds, reading, writing, watching the sun rise, etc.\nDopamine cues Cue dependant learning or pavlovian conditioning is when dopamine is released in the brain in response to a conditioned cue. This leads to pleasure in anticipation of a reward. When the cue happens, dopamine drops below baseline, which leads us to seek out the reward.\nDopamine levels below baseline drive craving. The cycle of craving can occur outside of conscious awareness. Dopamine levels raise once we get the reward, but falls below baseline if the reward doesn’t happen.\nLoss chasing: when the uncertainty of getting a reward is as reinforcing as the reward it self. Like gambling or likes on social media.\nThese conditioned reward pathways can cause permanent brain changes. But new pathways can always be forged with dopamine-healthy activities like human connection or exercise.\nEven learning releases dopamine.\nBalance is person independent. Pleasure and pain can happen at the same time like with spicy food. Something that one person finds pleasurable or painful may not be the same for someone else. And not everyone starts with a level balance.\nPeople injured in war are sometimes in less pain because they are pulled into a safer environment when they are being treated.\n“We are Cacti in a rainforest” -Dr. Tom Finucane. Our brains have evolved for a world of scarcity, but we live in a new world of abundance.\nDopamine Fasting We must abstain from the unwanted behavior in order to truly have clarity on how it effects us. High dopamine subtances or behaviors cloud or ability to see cause and effect. And young people are more immune to immediate negative impacts than adults.\nHere are 8 steps to a dopamine fast:\nGet information on the details of your dopamine use. What, when, how often? Find out your personal reason for doing the dopamine inducing behavior. Even seemingly irrational behavior is often rooted in personal logic. What problems is the drug or behavior causing? Short term? Long term? Go for a set period without the drug or behavior. Use mindfulness to observe your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations as separate from yourself. Abstaining gives new insight to the behaviors. Decide if you will continue using in a controlled way. Or go completely without. Experiment to find out what works and what doesn’t. “I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired”\nDo you want to be doing this 10 years from now? How about 5? 1? 6 months from now? You may as well try to stop now. Consider your current behaviors for your future self.\nYou must go without the drug or behavior in order to reset your dopamine baseline and to truly see the cause and effect between substance use and how you feel.\nYou can’t replace one drug with another because you will still be weighing down the pleasure side of the balance. And something less potent won’t feel like a reward because your baseline for pleasure is too high.\nIf you don’t feel better after a dopamine fast then you may have some other underlying medical problem. But you will feel worse before you feel better. Withdrawl can last anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months or longer.\nUse mindfulness to observe without judging yourself. Have compassion for yourself. The thoughts and emotions you have been running from will come crashing down on you during withdrawl. Instead of running, tolerate it.\nDon’t forget that moderation can backfire.\nLimit access through self-binding. Self-binding is placing barriers between you and the reward to help get over the limitations of willpower. Willpower gets tired the more we use it. This is a tool, not a fail safe.\nYou do self binding while your will is strong. Not when the cue, routine, reward cycle has already started and your willpower goes down.\nMake it harder to access the reward.\nThis can be through physical barriers or distance. Such as a ksafe or weight loss surgeries. It can also be based on time limits and finish lines. Such as setting a time of day to use or a reward for accomplishing something.\nNote \"Forgive yourself, you have problems like everyone else.\" Track your usage to become more aware. Overall awareness will help mitigate consumption.\nDelay discounting is when high dopamine messes with our ability to delay gratification. “Temporal horizons” shrink when we are under the spell of a drug. You become governed by the pleasure-pain balance, instead of by reason. You can no longer objectively evaluate immediate rewards vs their long term counterparts.\nWarning If you don't take control now, you may be doing this forever. The opposite is also true, immediate rewards activate emotion and reward parts of the brain. When you delay rewards, you activate the prefrontal cortex. Which is involved in planning and abstract thinking.\nCategorical self binding is avoiding anything that could entertain your addict mind. Like how scrolling instagram can lead to seeking out porn. Sort dopamine into categories. Ones that you will allow yourself to consume, and ones you do not. This helps avoid triggers that lead to craving.\nThis is useful for substances that we can’t eliminate all together but want to have a healthier relationship with like food, sex, smartphones, etc.\nThis can fail if you accidentally include a triggering behavior in your list of acceptable behaviors.\nYou can also transform an object into a symbol of restraint. Such as putting a single beer on display to remind you of what you are doing.\nRather than feeling restrained by this new way of living, you will feel liberated.\nIntimacy from drugs doesn’t last.\nThere are drugs may help with addictions, but have the potential to become addictive themselves. Perscription stimulants like adderal are the molecular equivalent to meth. They cause huge spikes of dopamine and have high high potential for abuse.\nThese drugs could also potentially make things worse in the long run and have unintended consequences.\nADHD drug treatment is associated with deterioration in academic and social-emotional functioning.\nAntidepressants may lead to tolerance and dependence and make depression worse in the long run (tardive dysphoria).\nInstead of feeling better than well, these drugs may make us feel other than well. And can limit our ability to experience the full range of emotions needed for a balanced life.\nWe may be making large portions of the population indifferent to intolerable circumstances. Corporations and governments have the potential to use drugs as a form of social control.\nThere are as many as 10,000 toddlers receiving stimulants like ritalin.\nWhen you are numb to everything, you lose your hunger for anything. Medications can be lifesaving, but there are other tools than can help.\nWhy you should lean on pain We feel great after a cold shower. The first seconds are painful, tell yourself this is temporary.\nTip James bond shower: Start with a normal shower, then end it cold for at least a minute. Dopamine and norepinephrine levels rise 250 and 530% above baseline respectively. And remain elevated hours after. And have been shown to raise serotonin and neuronal growth.\nPressing on the pain side of the balance can lead to pleasure. The dopamine that results is indirect and potentially longer lasting. Just like how the body restores balance by leaning toward pain after a pleasure stimuli, the body will restore balance towards pleasure from a painful stimuli.\n“With intermittent exposure to pain, our natural hedonic set point gets weighted to the side of pleasure, such that we become less vulnerable to pain and more able to feel pleasure over time.” -pg 145 Dopamine Nation\nSocrates on the relationship between pain and pleasure:\n“How strange would appear to be this thing that men call pleasure! And how curiously it is related to what is thought to be its opposite, pain! The two will never be found together in a man, and yet if you seek the one and obtain it, you are almost bound always to get the other as well, just as though they were both attached to one and the same head. . . . Wherever the one is found, the other follows up behind. So, in my case, since I had pain in my leg as a result of the fetters, pleasure seems to have come to follow it up.” -pg 147 Dopamine Nation\nHormesis Using pain to treat pain has been around forever.\nHormesis is the study of using small doses of “pain” to trigger the body’s adaptive processes. (Cold, heat, gravitational changes, radiation, food restriction, exercise, etc.) These adaptive processes improve tolerance and functionality of the system to harder challenges.\nIntermittent fasting in animals increased life span, reduced blood pressure, and improved Heart Rate Variability.\n“Exercise is immediately toxic to cells, leading to increased temperatures, noxious oxidants, and oxygen and glucose deprivation. Yet the evidence is overwhelming that exercise is health-promoting, and the absence of exercise, especially combined with chronic sedentary feeding—eating too much all day long—is deadly.”\nExercise increases many of the neurotransmitters involved in positive mood regulation: dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, endocannabinoids, and endogenous opioid peptides (endorphins). Exercise contributes to the birth of new neurons and supporting glial cells. Exercise even reduces the likelihood of using and getting addicted to drugs.\" -pg 150 Dopamine Nation\nDopamine and movement are deeply connected. Do obtain what we desire, we need to go get it. Do drugs just remind us that we have bodies?\nExercise is more beneficial to positive mood, sleep, cognition than any pill. Even a 30 minute walk is beneficial. Just remember that pleasure comes AFTER pain.\nThe extreme side of pain can cause it’s own addiction. So be careful. Too much pain can deplete dopamine, causing overconsumption. So just slightly lean into pain. Build progress over time.\nTruth telling Telling the truth is another “pain leads to pleasure”. You can trick yourself when you are lying. So you are inhibiting self-awareness as well when you tell the truth. Writing in a journal is a good way to master yourself with truth telling.\nDenial is caused by the disconnect between our reward pathway and higher brain regions. (Prefrontal cortex)\nPrefrontal coretex is involved in planning, storytelling, decision making, emotional regulation, etc.\nTelling the truth activates the prefrontal cortex and strengthens it through repeated use.\nAwareness What behavior or habit do you want to change? Why? And what would you be giving up if you stopped that behavior? What is one step you can take to change the behavior?\nHonesty makes connections with other humans We assume people will abandon us when we expose our vulnerabilities. But they really assure other people of their own doubts, fears, and weaknesses.\nHuman connection increases Oxytocin. Oxytocin binds to dopamine-secreting neurons and enhances the reward circuit tract. Human connection replaces addiction.\nConsuming leads to isolation. Because you replace the reward you get from Human connections with artificial rewards.\nHuman connection can be exploited as an addiction as well. When it is used for selfish gratifications rather than through shared humanity. Like when people are Grandstanding and manipulating.\nDo not share stories about your addictions to show off. Only share them to teach lessons. Tell accurate stories about yourself. Do not play the victim. Take responsibility. Accurate stories help you make accurate decisions.\nWrite down your character defects and ways those hurt your relationships.\nSocial media has led us to creating false self’s about what our lives are really like. If we don’t feel real, we isolate and become depersonalized.\nHonesty tethers ourselves to reality and makes us feel real in the world.\nGetting control of your addictions can lead others to do the same.\nKeep your promises to children. The children benefit and are better able to regulate their emotions.\nPeople will feel more confident around you because they can trust you.\nProsocial Shame Destructive shame is when the group condemns or shuns when someone makes a mistake. Over consumption leads to shame, which leads to lying, which leads to isolation, which continues the circle to over consumption.\nProsocial shame is when the group holds us closer and provides steps to redemption. It says that shame is useful for thriving communities. We all have our flaws and need forgiveness. Instead of leading to lying, it leads to truth telling and acceptance and breaks the cycle of addiction.\nIf we are open and honest to our children about our mistakes and struggles, children will be more open and honest with us about theirs. Admit when we have been wrong.\nWe feel deeply connected to others when we feel accepted despite our flaws.\nSocial media makes us compare ourselves to the entire world. Leading us to believe we should have done more.\nImmerse ourselves in the world instead of turning away from it.\nFinding balance does not happen instantly. It requires patience, courage, and maintenance. You must have faith that the small actions you take every day will pay off in the future.\nIf you made it this far… Please consider giving me some feedback. I want to become a better writer and help others grow along with me. Feedback is invaluable for this goal.\nThanks for reading!",

Knowing the balance between pain and pleasure is essential to living in modern day society. Where scarcity is no longer an issue. Our brains are not adapted for a world of abundance. So the forces that kept us alive for thousands of years, are now making us miserable.",

The output of the second command is the TXT value.\nAgain, you can check that site to make sure your DKIM, DMARC, and SPF entries are valid. That’s it!\nSetting up an E-mail Inbox In the article on SMTP and Postfix, we set up a simple Postfix server that we could use to programatically send mail with the mail command. In order to have a true and fully-functional mail server, users should be able to login to a mail client where they can read their inbox and send mail remotely. In order to achieve this we need Dovecot, which can store mails received by the server, authenticate user accounts and interact with mail.\nIf we’re setting up an inbox we will also want spam detection software, such as spam assassin.\nDovecot and Spamassassin apt install dovecot-imapd dovecot-sieve spamassassin spamcUnblock the imap port:\nufw allow 993Certificate We will want a SSL certificate for the mail. subdomain. We can get this with Certbot. Assuming we are using Nginx for our server otherwise, run:\ncertbot --nginx certonly -d mail.example.orgDNS We also need two little DNS records set on your domain registrar’s site/DNS server:\nAn MX record. Just put your domain, example.org, in the “Points to” field. A CNAME record. Host field: mail.example.org. “Points to” field: example.org. Configuring Dovecot Dovecot’s configuration file is in /etc/dovecot/docevot.conf. If you open that file, you will see this line: !include conf.d/*.conf which adds all the .conf files in /etc/dovecot/conf.d/ to the Dovecot configuration.\nOne can edit each of these files individually to get the needed configuration, but to make things easy here, delete or backup the main configuration file and we will replace it with one single config file with all important settings in it. Make sure you change ssl_cert and ssl_key accordingly.\n# Note that in the dovecot conf, you can use: # %u for username # %n for the name in name@domain.tld # %d for the domain # %h the user's home directory # Connections between the mail client and Dovecot needs to be encrypted ssl = required ssl_cert = \u003c/etc/letsencrypt/live/mail.example.org/fullchain.pem ssl_key = \u003c/etc/letsencrypt/live/mail.example.org/privkey.pem ssl_min_protocol = TLSv1.2 ssl_cipher_list = EECDH+ECDSA+AESGCM:EECDH+aRSA+AESGCM:EECDH+ECDSA+SHA256:EECDH+aRSA+SHA256:EECDH+ECDSA+SHA384:EECDH+ECDSA+SHA256:EECDH+aRSA+SHA384:EDH+aRSA+AESGCM:EDH+aRSA+SHA256:EDH+aRSA:EECDH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!EXP:!PSK:!SRP:!DSS:!RC4:!SEED ssl_prefer_server_ciphers = yes ssl_dh = \u003c/usr/share/dovecot/dh.pem auth_mechanisms = plain login auth_username_format = %n protocols = $protocols imap # Search for valid users in /etc/passwd userdb { driver = passwd } #Fallback: Use plain old PAM to find user passwords passdb { driver = pam } # Our mail for each user will be in ~/Mail, and the inbox will be ~/Mail/Inbox mail_location = maildir:~/Mail:INBOX=~/Mail/Inbox:LAYOUT=fs namespace inbox { inbox = yes mailbox Drafts { special_use = \\Drafts auto = subscribe } mailbox Junk { special_use = \\Junk auto = subscribe autoexpunge = 30d } mailbox Sent { special_use = \\Sent auto = subscribe } mailbox Trash { special_use = \\Trash } mailbox Archive { special_use = \\Archive } } # Here we let Postfix use Dovecot's authetication system. service auth { unix_listener /var/spool/postfix/private/auth { mode = 0660 user = postfix group = postfix } } protocol lda { mail_plugins = \\$mail_plugins sieve } protocol lmtp { mail_plugins = \\$mail_plugins sieve } plugin { sieve = ~/.dovecot.sieve sieve_default = /var/lib/dovecot/sieve/default.sieve sieve_dir = ~/.sieve sieve_global_dir = /var/lib/dovecot/sieve/ }Settings Explained Take a good look at the above settings to understand what’s going on. Some of the settings include:\nSSL settings to allow encrypted connections. The mail server will authenticate users against PAM/passwd, which means users you create on the server (so long as they are part of the mail group) will be able to receive and send mail. Default directories for a mail account: Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Junk, Trash and Archive. Create a unix_listener that will allow Postfix to authenticate users via Dovecot. Setup the Dovecot sieve plugin, which provides mail filtering facilities at time of final message delivery. Sieve scripts can be used to customize how messages are delivered, whether they’re forwarded or stored in special folders. Next, we can tell sieve to automatically move mail flagged as spam to the junk folder:\necho \"require [\\\"fileinto\\\", \\\"mailbox\\\"]; if header :contains \\\"X-Spam-Flag\\\" \\\"YES\\\" { fileinto \\\"Junk\\\"; }\" \u003e /var/lib/dovecot/sieve/default.sieveAfter that, we should create the vmail user and group, which will access the mails, and then update the sieve configuration:\ngrep -q '^vmail:' /etc/passwd || useradd vmail chown -R vmail:vmail /var/lib/dovecot sievec /var/lib/dovecot/sieve/default.sieveThen, enable pam authentication for Dovecot:\necho \"auth required pam_unix.so nullok account required pam_unix.so\" \u003e\u003e /etc/pam.d/dovecotConnecting Postfix and Dovecot We need to tell Postfix to look to Dovecot for authenticating users/passwords. Dovecot will be putting an authentication socket in /var/spool/postfix/private/auth.\npostconf -e 'smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes' postconf -e 'smtpd_sasl_type = dovecot' postconf -e 'smtpd_sasl_path = private/auth' postconf -e 'mailbox_command = /usr/lib/dovecot/deliver'Connecting Postfix and Spamassassin We will change /etc/postifx/master.cf so postfix can route mail through spamassassin. First we can cleanup the default configuration. Feel free to make a backup.\nsed -i '/^\\s*-o/d;/^\\s*submission/d;/^\\s*smtp/d' /etc/postfix/master.cfFinally, run this command to finish the configuration for spamassassin.\necho \"smtp unix - - n - - smtp smtp inet n - y - - smtpd -o content_filter=spamassassin submission inet n - y - - smtpd -o syslog_name=postfix/submission -o smtpd_tls_security_level=encrypt -o smtpd_sasl_auth_enable=yes -o smtpd_tls_auth_only=yes smtps inet n - y - - smtpd -o syslog_name=postfix/smtps -o smtpd_tls_wrappermode=yes -o smtpd_sasl_auth_enable=yes spamassassin unix - n n - - pipe user=debian-spamd argv=/usr/bin/spamc -f -e /usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -f \\${sender} \\${recipient}\" \u003e\u003e /etc/postfix/master.cfMake new mail accounts This is the easy part. Let’s say we want to add a user Billy and let him receive mail, run this:\nuseradd -m -G mail billy passwd billyAny user added to the mail group will be able to receive mail. Suppose a user Cassie already exists and we want to let her receive mail too. Just run:\nusermod -a -G mail cassieHarden your E-mail Server Hardening Postfix Put restrictions on servers sending mail to you.\npostconf -e 'smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated, permit_mynetworks, reject_unauth_destination, reject_unknown_recipient_domain'Anonymize Headers Use some regular expressions to prevent some meta data like a client’s ip address from being leaked.\necho \"/^Received:.*/ IGNORE /^X-Originating-IP:/ IGNORE /^User-Agent:/ IGNORE /^X-Mailer:/ IGNORE\" \u003e\u003e /etc/postfix/header_checksAdd this file to the postfix configuration:\npostconf -e \"header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks\"Fail2Ban If you’re not familiar with fail2Ban, it’s essentially a program which blocks bot’s and hacker’s login requests after a few invalid attempts.\napt-get install fail2banMake a local copy of the configuration file:\ncp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.localGo down to the # Mail servers line and paste this:\n[postfix] enabled = true port = smtp,ssmtp,submission filter = postfix logpath = /var/log/mail.log [sasl] enabled = true port = smtp,ssmtp,submission,imap2,imap3,imaps,pop3,pop3s filter = postfix-sasl # You might consider monitoring /var/log/mail.warn instead if you are # running postfix since it would provide the same log lines at the # \"warn\" level but overall at the smaller filesize. logpath = /var/log/mail.warn maxretry = 1 bantime = 21600 [dovecot] enabled = true port = smtp,ssmtp,submission,imap2,imap3,imaps,pop3,pop3s filter = dovecot logpath = /var/log/mail.logThis will only grant 2 login attempts and then block the requester for 6 hours.

    "content": " Date Read: 2024-04-22. How Strongly I Recommend It: 8/10\nThis second half of the book was almost an identical copy of the second half of the book. But still filled with solid advice on establishing a vision, settings goals, measuring the effectiveness of your actions, and other tidbits about being effective and taking action.\nI have been implementing most of this and needed to go back through to make sure I’ve got down the process.\nI highly advise you make your own outline so you do not have to read everything “twice again”.\nThe barrier between the life you are living and the life you want is effective execution. Getting in shape is not a knowledge problem, it’s an execution problem. In order to maintain effective execution, you must:\nFocus on the things that matter Maintain a sense of urgency Get rid of low value activity Annual goals remove the sense of urgency we need to achieve our goals. 12 weeks is long enough to get things done, but short enough to not let you lose sight of your goals. Every 12 weeks you get a fresh start.\nIf you have had a bad 12 week year you can shake it off and start fresh. If you have had a good 12 week year, then you can build off the momentum.\nAt the end of each 12 week year, take a week of to reflect, regroup, and re-energize. You have 4 times as many opportunities to set new goals and celebrate your accomplishments.\nEach weeks counts. And each day counts as you increase your focus on a few important daily tasks. Focusing on the short term keeps you from getting ahead of yourself.\nYou need a strong emotional stake in your goals Action is uncomfortable, you must have values in place. You must value your higher purpose more than your comfort. If you establish a compelling vision of the future. And align your short term goals and plans with that vision. Then it will be easier to cope with short term discomforts.\nQuestions to ask when creating your vision: What do you truly want to achieve? What legacy do you want to create? What do you want for yourself and your family? What do you want spiritually? What level of security do you seek? What level of income and fulfillment do you want from your career? What interests do you wish you could pursue? What do you really want to do with the time you have been allotted? You create things mentally before you create them physically. And you will never outpace your mental models. Vision is where you engage your thinking about what is possible for you.\nPeople focus on only their career or business. But those are only certain aspects of life. You need to establish a vision of your whole life, and align your business goals around that.\nYou need to make your vision compelling enough to act on it. This is what creates the emotional connection needed to act on your goals.\nThis creates passion.\nThe execution system The eight fundamental elements can be broken down into 5 disciplines and 3 principles.\n5 Disciplines\nVision Planning Process Control Measurement Time use 3 Principles\nAccountability Commitment Greatness in the moment How to create a personal vision Find out what you want in all areas of life:\nSpiritual Relationships Family Income Lifestyle Health Community Your career or business vision is is more powerful when it is developed in light of your personal vision. Once you have a personal vision, you can figure exactly the amount of income or production you need from your career or business.\nBy thinking about your vision often, your strengthen the areas of the brain that would help you make that happen.\nShift from a “How?” mindset to a “What if?” mindset. This helps you see your vision as possible. Then to “How might I?” and determine a plan. This helps you see your vision as probable.\nNext, Implement your plan. This moves your vision from probable to Given.\nThree time horizons for your vision Long term aspirations Mid-term (3 years) 12 weeks Long term aspirations Imagine and embrace all possibilities. What do you want to have, do, and be in your life? What is most important to you in each life category? How much free time? What level of income?\nWhat is your vision 5, 10, and 15 years into the future?\nMid-term (3 years) What do you want to create over the next 3 years based on your long term vision?\nAsk yourself these questions Why are these things important to you? What does your vision unlock for you? What will be different for you, and those around you, if you reach that goal? Who will you share your vision with? How often have you looked at your vision? What risks or barriers might get in the way?\nTeam or family vision Have each member work through their personal visions. Then come together and make a group vision that aligns with everyone’s personal visions.\nDo this Take your vision seriously. Keep it in front of you and align your plans with it. Review it often. Think BIG. Your vision should challenge you. Share your vision with others, print it out, review it daily. Find ways to make it more meaningful and vivid. Reflect on each day. Was it filled with activity that moved you toward your vision? What action will you take tomorrow? The 12 week year A vision without a plan is just a dream. Working from a plan helps you focus on the right things, saves you time, and reduces mistakes. You make your mistakes when writing your plan down on paper. A plan helps you cut through unimportant distractions that pop up every day.\nQuarterly goals are typically smaller goals that help you get to your annual goals. 12 week years are shrinking your annual goals into 12 weeks. Each 12 weeks stands alone.\n12 weeks is a more predictable time frame. The farther the goal, the more unpredictable. Which makes it harder and harder to plan for. it’s nearly impossible to predict what your actions should be 12 months into the future.\n12 weeks narrows your focus and keeps you from spreading yourself too thin. 12 weeks also gives you structure.\n1. Set goals Identify your 1-3 goals for the 12 weeks. This goals are the next 1-3 steps toward your long term vision. Then, create the tactics, or the daily or weekly actions you need to take to reach those goals.\nConsistent action on few critical tasks is what drives success. Like dropping water wearing away on a stone.\nSpend 20 minutes at the beginning of each week to review your previous week and plan the new one. Spend the first 5 minutes of each day reviewing your weekly plan and setting your plan for the day accordingly.\nCheck in with this plan multiple times per day and make sure you are executing on it. A good goal is specific and measurable, positively stated, realistic, and time bound.\nAsk yourself why this goal is important to you? What will be different if your achieve this goal?\nIs this in line with your vision?\n2. Create a plan Set the actions needed, and when they are to be acted on, as daily or weekly tasks. Brainstorm on a sheet of paper all of the things you need to do to or ideas to achieve your goal.\nWhat actions will you struggle with? What can you do to overcome those struggles? Select the smallest number of the brainstormed actions needed to achieve the goal.\nTrying to execute too many tactics will spread you thin.\nKeep it simple.\n3. Set up Process controls Process controls are what you do to keep your plan from breaking down in a lapse of willpower. The two elements of process control are a weekly plan, and peer support.\nA weekly plan gives you clarity. Not all is lost when you lose 50% of a week.\nPeer support creates room for getting help from others. Meet on a weekly basis to discuss progress, struggles, and challenges. Encourage one another. Form a group of 2-4 committed people.\nWeekly meeting agenda:\nIndividual report Results to date Weekly execution score Intentions for the coming week Feedback and suggestions from the group Discuss what has been working and how to incorporate that into each other’s plan Encouragement Weekly plan Take 15 minutes at the beginning of each week to plan the week on paper. Make sure you include all of your tasks for the week. Do not assume each week will be the same. And do not (usually) add extra tactics that weren’t in the original plan. Use this plan to guide your day.\nOnly change your plan if you have been executing and it’s not working.\nWeekly Score Measuring your success will tell you if what you are doing it working. And lets you know what adjustments to make. The data you get from measuring does not care about efforts or intentions. Only on outcomes. Are you getting the outcome you desire?\nThe sooner you confront yout outcomes, the sooner you can figure out what works and what doesn’t. Then you can shift your focus to what is working.\nMeasure lead and lag indicators.\nLag indicators measure overall results such as lbs lost, money made, etc. Lead indicators measure the activities that produce the results. Are you following through with your plan?\nYou can always control results, but you can control execution in real time. So Lead indicators should be your primary focus.\nIf you are not hitting your goals, is it a problem with the plan? Or with the execution of that plan? Is your strategy flawed? Or are you failing to implement that strategy? Once you identify your problem, you can address it head on.\nEstablish a set of lead and lag indicators for each of your goals. And measure your lead indicators as a percentage of tactics completed. (measuring execution, not results.) Score yourself on the percentage of tactics completed that week.\nStrive for excellence, not perfection. Aim for 85% and you will most likely achieve your objectives. Even 65-70% is better than nothing.\nFacing the reality of your actions is hard. You will be uncomfortable if you are not doing the things you need to do. (Productive tension)\nUse this as a catalyst for change, instead of running away.\nTeam/Family Process Control Does everyone have a plan for each week? Are they scoring each week? Are they participating in a weekly group meeting?\n4. Use your time with purpose Say no to things that go against your goals. Organize your life around your priorities that make progress toward your vision. Be intentional about how you allocate your time.\nT.V. may be beneficial in some ways, but helping us live a life of significance is not one of them.\nYou may be doing busy work that is actually unimportant to the goals at hand.\nAlign your time and energy with what you do best and what you enjoy doing.\n5. Performance time Blocking out time chunks to work on important tasks. There are three categories of performance time:\nStrategic blocks Buffer blocks Breakout blocks Strategic blocks 3 hour block of time scheduled early into each week. Block out every distractions and work on core tasks. Reschedule if this gets interrupted. Time to work on your business not in it. Focus on one thing at a time. NO DISTRACTIONS!\nConnect with your vision 12 week review Assess performance breakdowns Work on tactics Buffer blocks For unplanned and low value activities lie checking email, phone calls, organizing, etc. 1-2 30 minute buffer blocks per day.\nBreakout blocks Taking time away from work. 3 hours long and spent on things other than your business. Used to refresh and reinvigorate your mind. Helps prevent burnout and create free time.\n6. Creating a routine Create an ideal week calendar where your schedule your performance time and organize critical tasks so that you will be most productive. Consider when you tend to be at your best. And schedule important tasks around those times.\n7. Taking ownership Own your results regardless of circumstances. Tap into your resources and give it your best. Own the things you can control (Your thinking and actions). Be willing to confront the truth about your situation.\nLearn from failures and do not place blame.\nRemove the victim mindset. Stop feeling sorry for yourself.\nBe willing to take new and improved actions. And surround yourself with people who also take ownership.\nClarify expectations. Learn from life and focus on the future. Acknowledge reality.\nFocus on the things that you can control.\n8. 12 week commitments Commitments are not broken when things get hard. Commitment fosters trust, confidence, and improves results. You are bound emotionally to a course of action.\nWhen you are interested in something it can be abandoned. When you are committed, you are bound to results. You make no excuses.\nKeys to successful commitments You have a strong desire that is meaningful. You identify the one or two core actions that will give you the result. You identify the costs associated with keeping the commitment. You act on the commitments rather than on your feelings. 12 week commitments are easier that 12 months ones. With a true commitment, don’t give yourself an out. Even if you fail. You gave it your all.\nDon’t give up if you break a commitment once. And confront missed commitments.\nValue your word.\nDon’t over commit by taking on more than you can handle. Go public with your commitments and find a buddy.\nGreatness happens in the moment Your daily actions decide your greatness long before the results ever show up. The daily difference between mediocrity and greatness is slim. But the difference down the road is tremendous.\nIntentional imbalance Like balance is where you are purposeful about where your spend your time and efforts. It is not about spending equal time in all areas of life. You identify the most important areas of your life to work on, and set your 12 week goals to make progress in those areas.\nThen, re evaluate the areas of yourlife that need work for the next 12 weeks. Rate the areas of your life out of 10. (Spiritual, Relationships, Family, Income, Lifestyle, Health, Community)\nThen Work on the lowest ones.\nThe emotional cycle of change 5 stages people move through emotionally when changing their behavior\nUninformed Optimism We imagine all of the benefits but have not experienced the costs. Informed Pessimism You begin to experience the costs and wonder if they are worth the end goal. Valley of despair When most people give up. All of the pain of change is felt and the benefits seem far away or unimportant. Informed Optimism New actions are becoming routine and you start to feel the benefits. Success and fulfillment Cost of change are gone, benefits are fully realized Every time you complete this cycle, your capacity and confidence increase. Awareness of this cycle is important to help you manage negative emotions.\nAuthor book recommendations:\nSwitch by Chip and Dan Heath The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg Feel the Fear and do it anyway by Susan Jeffers If you made it this far… Please consider giving me some feedback. I want to become a better writer and help others grow along with me. Feedback is invaluable for this goal.\nThanks for reading!",

front door, turn away and step away if dog jumps.\nOnce they sit, click treat and pet\nIf they start to jump up again, turn and step away\nBehavior Chain – a series of behaviors that get chained

up.\nDon’t ignore your dog when they are doing good\nAsking for an incompatible Behavior Say sit or down before they have a chance to jump up and click reward\nThis only works if they immediately respond to the replacement command\nIf you have to repeat the cue several times with Rambo jumping up on you then you are rewarding them with attention for jumping and teaching them to ignore your commands\nLet’s Walk When you tolerate pulling, your dog learns that pulling gets them where they want to go\nIf you want to get fancy, you can teach your dog different cues for walking in different positions\nFor now, think of walks as training games rather than to get to a destination or exercise.\nKeep sessions short at first\nDrive them to off leash play areas or other destinations until they get good at walking\nPractice after they have burned off some excess energy\nHang out and walk around for a bit, everytime your dog is walking near you, click and treat\nUse verbal “let’s walk” cue once they get the hang of it.\nGradually increase distractions\nTurn back on them if they get crazy\nCan use oops cue\nPick back up if they calm sit\nTake thrill out of they leash by picking it up randomly throughout the day.\nFor outside bring megasupply of treats and clicker\nStand and wait if they hit the end of their leash\nClick anytime the leash is loose\nChange directions for more loose leash opportunities\nDo not jerk the leash\nDo not let them get environmental rewards for pulling\nLet them earn environmental rewards with Cue “go sniff!”\nCan use touch command to show them what to do\nUse front-clip no-pull harness for dog that drags\nIf they pull back on treat shape them forward with clicks\nDon’t let them get rewarded for stopping\nUse high value treat for outdoors save that treat for only outdoors\nRemember to back up a few steps if you get derailed\nSit on a bench for an hour with treats to desensitize them to being outdoors\nShake Try shaping, luring, or molding.\nLefty/Righty Add left and right verbal cue for each paw\nHigh Five CLick any touch of their paw to your palm and shape more vigorous responses\nWave Hand signal – palm up and wiggle your fingers\nGet them frustrated with no click until they jerk their hand higher, click and reward\nTether Time out Use tether if dog is out of control\nOnly use leash as tether if dog won’t chew on

Rather than habituating to a sound such as the doorbell, a dog may become more and more reactive each time the stimulus occurs. Thunder sensitivity is a perfect example of this.\nLearned irrelevance is similar to habituation. It applies to a dog who has learned to ignore a specific cue, rather than become accustomed to a startling stimulus. This is not deliberate willfulness on the dog’s part, but rather her lack of response to a cue that has failed to have consistent and sufficiently strong significance attached to it. The cue becomes meaningless if it doesn’t have a consequence.\n“poisoned cue.” A cue becomes poisoned when it sometimes has a negative consequence instead of a positive one.\nit will be easier for you to train her to come with a new cue than to try to make the association consistently positive.\nI have heard owners and trainers use words such as close, let’s go, and here in place of a poisoned Come.\nOnce you’ve trained a new Come cue, you have to remember not to poison that one too. If you have to do something to your dog that she’s not fond of, do something wonderful when she gets to you, and a few minutes later end the fun and do the not-so-nice thing.\nOr go get her instead of calling her to you. Meanwhile, make it a point to change her association with the things she doesn’t like. Teach her that a hand moving toward her collar makes yummy treats happen.\nTeach her that a hand moving toward her paw makes yummy treats happen. Then touching her paw. Then holding her paw. Then touching her paw with nail clippers. This process of counterconditioning and desensitization—changing the association with a stimulus—can be applied in countless training and behavior modification situations.\nIt works best when done gradually with numerous repetitions at each step, and not moving on until the dog is obviously happy about the process at each step.\nThe fewer things a dog must do in her world (or have done to her) that she doesn’t like, the less likely you are to poison her Come cue!\nSALIENCE When we say something is salient to a dog, we mean it has noticeable significance to her. Your dog learns to sit even in the face of distractions because the hotdog you are holding in front of her face is very salient.\nsignificant. The salient stimuli in the environment—you, your hotdogs, and the Sit cue—are more significant than the distractions. They overshadow the dog barking across the street, the skateboarder whizzing by on the road, the slamming of a car door down the block. If your dog is too distracted to respond to the Sit cue, then the distractions are more salient than you and your hotdogs.\nYou either need to move your training to a less distracting environment, or find a way to make you, your treats, and your cues more significant to your dog.\nBLOCKING when the use of a known cue overrides the dog’s ability to learn a new cue for the same behavior. Keep in mind that while dogs can only learn one response to a particular cue (sit must always mean “sit,” it can’t sometimes mean lie down), they can learn several cues that all mean the same behavior.\n(treat), I introduce the verbal cue and explain that any new cue being taught must always precede the known cue.\nI use a demo dog to show them that the dog doesn’t initially understand or respond to the word down until we associate it with the luring motion that means “down” to the dog.\nThe motion is salient to the dog—the word is not. I explain to my students that in order for the dog to hear the word and learn that it also has significance, they must say the word first, then lure the dog down.\nIf they give the verbal cue at the same time or after they lure, the lure blocks the dog’s ability to learn the new cue. With enough repetitions of the sequence—verbal cue, followed by lure (and click! and treat when the dog performs the behavior)—the dog will learn that the verbal cue also has salience, and you will no longer need to lure her down—she will lie down when you give her the verbal cue.\nFADING THE LURE One of the biggest complaints you’ll hear about positive training is that you always have to have food in your hand to get your dog to do what you ask. This is true only if you don’t make the effort to fade your lures—that is, to get your dog to respond to your cues when there’s no treat in sight. If you don’t fade lures fairly early in your training program, you and your dog can both become dependent on the presence of food to get behaviors to happen. The good news is it’s easy to fade lures; you just have to remember to follow the steps to do it. Let’s take Down as our example:\nLure the behavior: Move your treat toward the floor, clicking your dog for following, giving a nibble of treat with each click!\nAdd the cue: When she lures down easily every time, say the Down cue each time just before you lure her down. Repeat a half-dozen times. Remember to click! and treat each time.\nPause before luring: Now say “Down!” and pause. Wait for several seconds, then lure her down. Click! Treat. By following the word with the lure, you are translating, telling her that the word down means exactly the same thing as moving the treat toward the floor. Repeat several times.\nAdd a little body language: As you say “Down!” or immediately thereafter, bend forward just a tiny bit from the waist. Since you probably bend forward when you lure, this little body language hint might jump-start your dog’s brain into moving down. If not, wait a few seconds and then lure.\nWatch for clues: Sometimes your dog will make small movements that tell you she’s starting to make the connection between the cue and the behavior. When you give the Down cue, she may look at the floor or lower her shoulders a little bit and then look at you as if to say, “Is this right? Is this what you mean?” If you catch these clues with a click! and quickly lure her the rest of the way, you’ve answered her question and she’ll probably understand and respond to the cue more quickly.\nEXTINCTION Extinction means taking a behavior that has been reinforced and making it go away by removing all reinforcement.\nYou can deliberately extinguish an unwelcome behavior by taking away any reinforcement your dog might be getting for it. We extinguish the behavior of jumping up by making sure no one pets, talks to, or looks at the dog when she jumps, and by stepping away so she doesn’t even have the pleasure of making contact with her paws.\nYou can also accidentally extinguish a desired behavior by forgetting to reinforce it or by not reinforcing it enough. Reinforcement isn’t always treats—it’s anything your dog likes: toys, play, eye contact, praise, pets, runs . . .\nWhen you use extinction to make a behavior go away, be aware that there is often an extinction burst—the behavior gets worse before it gets better because the dog is trying really hard to get reinforcement for a behavior that paid off in the past.\nYou want to be sure not to reinforce the dog during an extinction burst, or you’ve just taught her that trying harder gets reinforced. Don’t give in (unless the dog is in danger of injuring herself); comfort yourself with the knowledge that the extinction burst usually means you’re close to success.\nspontaneous recovery. Days, weeks, or even months after you extinguished a behavior, it suddenly rears its ugly head again,\nof circumstances occurred to refire the same old neuron pathway. The good news is, assuming you make sure the behavior isn’t reinforced, it should go away again quickly, and much more easily than the first time.\nPremack you can use a more rewarding behavior as the reinforcer for a less rewarding behavior, thereby improving the performance of the lesser behavior.\nFor example, if your dog would rather chase a bunny than come when you call her, you can use the Premack principle to teach her that she will get to chase a bunny—sometimes—if she comes to you first.\nYou start by using Premack indoors in a controlled environment to teach her how it works, and when she’s doing well there, move her outside. Leave your dog on a sit/stay and walk across the room. Your helper, with a plate of tasty treats, stands halfway between you and your dog, slightly off to one side. Your helper should also have a bowl to cover the treats when your dog tries to eat them. Now call your dog. If she stops to investigate the plate of treats, the helper covers the plate and doesn’t let her have a taste.\nYou keep calling your dog cheerfully and enthusiastically. When she finally comes to you, gently grasp her collar, say “Good girl!” then release her collar and say “Go get it!” Race with your dog back to the treats, now uncovered, and let her have a couple of bites.\nThen cover the plate and try it again. Eventually—sometimes surprisingly quickly—she will realize that she gets the treats sooner if she comes to you first and she will fly past the uncovered plate as fast as she can. This principle is also sometimes called Grandma’s Law, expressed as “You have to eat your vegetables before you can eat your dessert.”\nThere are a couple of drawbacks to using Premack in real life: (1) If the vegetables are too unpalatable, dessert may also lose its appeal; and (2) you can’t control the bunnies.\nGeneralization how do you help your dog learn to generalize operant behaviors? By doing exactly what your trainer probably told you to do—practice with her in as many different places as possible.\nCHAINING AND BACKCHAINING The behaviors are linked together so that each behavior is the signal for the next behavior in the chain, and the opportunity to perform the next behavior becomes the reinforcer for the previous one.\nBackchaining begins with the last behavior in the chain. Each step is added in reverse order, until the dog is performing the complete behavior. The theory is that when you teach the last thing first, your dog is always moving toward what she knows best, so she gains confidence as she learns the new links in the chain. The theory works.\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF PARSIMONY unless there is evidence to the contrary, you must account for a phenomenon with the simplest explanation available.\nHouse Training think in terms of what you want him to do.\nhousetraining, an ounce of prevention is worth many pounds of cure.\nwill start using the phrase Do It when he starts to eliminate. This will teach him to go to the bathroom on cue\nSocial Misfits As they get older (8 to 16 weeks), they are given careful exposure to other stimuli—visits to the vet hospital and groomer; walks in town; rides on elevators and escalators; sounds of cars, motorcycles, and skateboards; people of different ages, sexes, and ethnic backgrounds; people who dress, talk, and move in strange ways; and people with umbrellas, crutches, wheelchairs, and facial hair. The more positive exposures a dog has to a wide variety of experiences during this period, the more confident and well adjusted she will be throughout her life, and the more easily she will accept new experiences, even without prior exposure.\nthe steps to take to foster courage in an unsocialized canine:\nTeach your dog a reward marker.\nReward-mark his entire meal. If the dog is extremely unsocialized—fearful even of you—let this be the only way she gets to eat: by being in your company and, eventually when she’s brave enough, by eating out of your hand. She needs to learn that you are the source of all good things. Reward-marking won’t work well for a free-roaming feral dog—she will have access to other food sources and won’t have to tolerate your presence to find food.\nReward-mark her for calm behavior around others.\nMake a list of her fear triggers.\nUse counterconditioning and desensitization. Desensitization is the process of gradually acclimating the dog to the things she is afraid of. Counterconditioning means replacing her involuntary undesirable reaction—fear—with a more desirable one that is incompatible with fear, such as the eager anticipation of a tasty treat.\nReward-mark while others feed treats.\nTeach her to target.\nCaution: Avoid Coddling!\nBe Happy Healthy dogs chew. They also bark, dig, and run around. These behaviors are natural and necessary for them.\nteach him to go to the bathroom at appropriate appropriate times, in appropriate places. You will be far more successful in dealing with the challenges of chewing, digging, and barking if you address these natural behaviors the same way.\nCHOOSE YOUR CHEWS Stuffed Kong toys, marrow bones, and other indestructible but inviting chew objects are better choices than items that resemble our valued human possessions. Discarded socks and old tennis shoes teach a pup to head for the closet floor and the laundry basket when the chewing urge is strong.\nCarrots, apples, and other hard raw fruits and vegetables are also ideal puppy chews—\nGoodie Ship stuffed with liver treats.\nChewing is also a good stress reliever, which is why dogs who are anxious about being left alone at home often become destructive.\npuppies should gradually be conditioned to being left alone so they can overcome their very strong and natural instinct to always be in the company of their pack. Providing your dog with a desirable and appropriate chew object prior to your calm departure can often help prevent separation anxiety from becoming a problem.\nSafety First Dogs have been known to choke on rawhide, which can get soft and slimy when chewed,\nRope toys can shred, and if swallowed, the pieces of string can become entangled in a dog’s intestines—a life-threatening situation. Plastic eyes, noses, and squeakers from plush toys also pose a hazard to your dog’s well-being.\nthe black rubber Kong toys are among the toughest\nOldies but Goodies you can regularly give your dog chicken and turkey wings and necks. Note: These are fed raw, not cooked, as part of a complete diet plan.\nThe Whole Dog Journal is a good resource for information on feeding a natural, healthy diet, as are books by Dr. Ian Billinghurst.\nPunishing Jaws after you take a forbidden object away from him does no good—he is likely to think that the last thing he did (giving up the object) is what he’s being punished for. Jaws can learn very quickly that chewing on an item of high value to humans is a good thing to do because it will initiate a rousing game of chase the puppy. If you punish him after you catch him, you won’t teach him not to play the game; you’ll just teach him to run faster next time! Don’t let him suck you into his game—use management and supervision to interrupt and redirect him before he is doing doughnuts around the dining room table with your $150 running shoe in his mouth.\nDigging Dogs who are most likely to engage in inappropriate digging are those who are left to their own devices in the backyard for long periods.\nmy philosophy of dog-human relationships, they belong anyway. Dogs are companion animals, and they serve that function best when they share our homes (dens) with us. Dogs who are exiled to a pen or to the backyard are often excruciatingly bored and/or lonely, which gives rise to a long list of behavior problems, including barking, digging, escaping, hyperactivity, poor socialization, and aggression.\nIf you want, you can even encourage your dog to dig—in the right place. Just as you teach your dog when and where it’s okay to go to the bathroom, you can teach Dozer when and where it’s okay for him to dig. You can build a wooden digging box frame—spacious enough to accommodate Dozer’s size with room to spare—and set it where you want him to dig. Dig up the dirt within the framed area so it is soft and inviting. If your dirt is hard clay, add sand and potting soil to break up the soil and keep it soft. Now invite Dozer to dig in his box by burying a toy or bone just beneath the surface of the soil. Get excited and tell Dozer to go dig. Then help him dig up the toy. Repeat this game often, until he will run to his box and start digging from anywhere in the yard when you tell him to go dig. You can bury toys and bones in the box when he’s not looking so that he never knows what he’ll find in there. If you do see him starting to dig where he shouldn’t, say “Oops! Go dig!” to interrupt and invite him back to the box. If he doesn’t have lots of unsupervised time to reward himself for digging in the wrong places, he will eventually confine his digging to his box. An additional benefit to teaching him the Go Dig cue is that you can use it anytime you are in a place where digging is allowed—like the beach, where digging in the sand is great fun for dogs and humans alike. You can also make use of his talents when you need a hole dug—to plant a tree, put in fence posts, or perhaps bury a treasure.\nBarking Simply slapping a no-bark electric shock collar (shudder) around the backyard dog’s neck may stop the barking, but it does nothing to help the dog become less bored, lonely, or frustrated. My answer to the dog owner who asks how to get a dog to stop barking in the backyard day and night is simply to bring him indoors. This relieves his loneliness because: • He is now more a part of the family • It does away with boredom because there are more interesting things going on inside the house\n• It shuts out the stimuli that frustrate him—like squirrels in the trees and cats on the fence • It lifts the burden from his shoulders of feeling like he’s the only member of the pack who is guarding the den\nwe just want to be able to turn the barking off when we want. You can do this with a positive interrupt, or you can get more inventive and teach Woofie to bark on cue in order to teach him to stop barking on cue.\nTo use the positive interrupt, begin by teaching Woofie that over here means “Turn toward me for a click! and a treat.” Practice this on-leash with a small distraction, like sniffing a bush, until Woofie looks to you eagerly when he hears the Over Here cue.\n“Over Here!” As soon as he stops barking and turns toward you for his treat, click! and tell him “Quiet. Good boy!” then click! again for the quiet and give him another treat. (I actually have my clients say “Thank you!” to their dogs when we do this, to remind them that we really do appreciate having our dogs alert us to unusual visitors and events.)\nwhatever it is that gets Woofie to bark—walking up the sidewalk, knocking on the door, opening the door, or whatever. The more you repeat it, the less excited\nWoofie will be about the knock on the door and the quicker he will be to turn toward you on the Over Here cue. Of course, the next time someone comes to the door, Woofie will be excited all over again—it takes time and numerous repetitions of this exercise to get Woofie to give up his deeply ingrained, out-of-control barking behavior. Remember that you are not using the Quiet cue to make your dog stop barking—you are waiting until he stops barking and then telling him that the behavior of not barking is called quiet. In time, when Woofie has learned to associate the word with the behavior of being quiet, you will be able to get him to stop barking with the Quiet cue, but if you use it in the beginning while he’s barking, you will be teaching him that quiet actually means “bark.” In fact, I honestly believe that a lot of dogs think their owners are barking with them when they are actually yelling at them to shut up! I avoid teaching dogs to bark on cue if they don’t already bark a lot, but for those who are problem barkers, it can be a superb solution to the barking behavior challenge. Getting the bark on cue is the easy part—barky dogs are usually more than willing to offer the behavior. You probably already know what stimulates Woofie to bark. If it’s a knock on the door, then knock on the door, click! when he barks, and feed him a treat. If this works, do it again, but say “Speak!” or “Who’s there?” just before you knock. When he barks, click! and treat. Because he likes to bark anyway, in very short order he will probably bark for you on just the verbal cue, without the knock. Aside from using this exercise to teach Woofie to be quiet on cue, it can also be useful for self-protection. I had one client who taught her dog that What Do You Want? was the cue to start barking. She could then use it if she felt threatened by an approaching stranger, and her very friendly dog would bark nonstop and quite convincingly keep the potential bad guy at a distance. Now that you have the bark on cue, you can teach Quiet or Enough by clicking and rewarding a pause in the barking. Again, remember that in the beginning you won’t be asking Woofie to stop barking with the verbal cue; you’ll just be associating the quiet word with the cessation of barking. Eventually, when you know he has made the connection between the word and the behavior, you will be able to use the cue to ask him to stop barking. Remember first to thank him for alerting you to something going on in the world. You never know when he might be trying to tell you that there’s a burglar outside, that Timmy has fallen into the well, or that your horses are running down your driveway.\nSeparation Anxiety Separation anxiety (SA), the canine equivalent of a panic disorder,\nA less intense stress response in dogs over being left alone is called isolation distress (ID).\nSpend fifteen to twenty minutes in a hard play session every morning to take the edge off Shep’s energy level before you leave the house.\n• Provide as much exercise as possible at other times of the day as well. A dog who has a reservoir of pent-up energy is more stressed than one who is tired. A tired dog is usually a happier and better-behaved dog.\n• Be calm when you leave and return. Dramatic good-byes and hellos raise Shep’s anxiety level.\n• Give Shep a Kong toy or marrow bone filled with peanut butter or cheese just before you leave.\n• Do not crate Shep unless you know she stays calm in the crate while you are gone.\nBiting all dogs can bite. And under the right set of circumstances, the gentlest, most loving dog can be induced to bite.\nhigh. Aggression is caused by stress. Each thing (stimulus) that causes a dog stress is a small building block (stressor) toward that dog’s bite threshold.\na dozen or more commonly recognized classifications of aggression, including status-related aggression, fear-related aggression, maternal aggression (a mom protecting her puppies), play aggression (when a dog’s level of arousal escalates during play and turns into aggression), displaced aggression, pain aggression, territorial aggression, possession aggression, protection aggression, barrier aggression, and redirected aggression.\nResource Guarding You can build on this foundation by working with Gimme at her mealtimes in a four-week resource-guarding program. Begin by setting her dish on the counter and putting her kibble in it. During week one, feed her the entire meal by hand, one kibble at a time. Have other family members take turns feeding her, and even allow an occasional visitor to do it so that she really gets the concept that humans deliver resources. Be sure to include children in the mix—you want her to realize that having small humans around her food bowl is a good thing. In week two, set Gimme’s empty food bowl on the floor and put her meal in a second dish on the counter. Now drop a few kibbles into her dish, and while she is eating those, drop a few more. You want her to realize that when a human hand approaches her bowl it is not coming to take her food away; instead, more food is coming. Again, have all the family participate, and include an occasional friend in the mealtime ritual. During week three, put her bowl on the floor with about ¼ of her meal already in it. As she eats, continue to add more kibble, and occasionally add something really wonderful, like a slice of hot dog, chicken, or roast beef. Now you are teaching her that not only does the approaching hand bring more food, it actually brings better food. By now she should be pretty well convinced that having humans around her food bowl is a wonderful idea. In the final week of your food bowl training, continue to drop kibble into her bowl as she eats. Now, assuming that she is showing absolutely no signs of food guarding when you reach toward her bowl, pick the bowl up while at the same time you drop pieces of her really wonderful treat on the floor. The message you’re giving to Gimme is that food bowl going away = really wonderful food on the ground. While you have the food bowl in your hand, put a few more pieces of the really wonderful treat in it and set it back down on the ground after she has finished the treats you dropped. You are simply reinforcing the concept that having humans mess with her food bowl is good—it returns to her with even better stuff in it. If you, and others, for the rest of Gimme’s life, continue to occasionally drop great stuff in her bowl while she is eating, she will always recognize humans near her bowl as a good thing and should never develop a food-guarding problem.\nDogs do what feels good, or, as behaviorists say, behavior is reward driven. If your dog is doing something that you want to change, at some level it is rewarding to her. Find out what the reward is and you are well on your way to changing the behavior.\nYour attention is a huge reinforcer. Even negative attention (like yelling) is reinforcing—in your dog’s mind, something is better than nothing.\nBabies and Kids make good things happen whenever babies were around.\nDon’t be stingy here—leave Lady’s dinner kibble at home. Instead, get out the hot dogs, cheese, steak, chicken—whatever Lady likes best—and keep feeding her one tiny piece at a time. You don’t even need to click! her for this; you’re not trying to change or teach a behavior; you’re trying to influence the way that her brain responds to the presence of children. (This is called classical conditioning, like Pavlov’s salivating dogs.) We just want Lady to realize that the presence of babies and small children is a reliable predictor of wonderful treats.\nYou can also have the babies’ parents or babysitters and some well-behaved small children feed treats to Lady and pet her gently so that she realizes that not only do good things happen when kids are around, some of the good things actually come from the children.\n• Never leave dogs, babies, and/or small children (under age 10—or older if the dog is large and active) together unsupervised. No matter how trustworthy the dog, a responsible adult must always be actively observing the interaction between dog and baby human(s).\n• Give the dog an escape route. When Junior starts moving, he can be pretty determined and irritating.\ntoddler fingers in her eyes, ears, and mouth. Teach Lady how to jump over a low barrier to reach safety if she has had enough baby for the moment. Dogs who can’t escape their tiny tormentors are more likely to bite in self-defense. • Teach your dog bite inhibition so that if she does feel compelled to bite in self-defense, she will give an inhibited warning bite rather than a serious bite. (See chapter 22, “A Biting Commentary.”) • Teach your children to respect the dog. Children should handle dogs gently and kindly. As soon as Junior is old enough to understand, he needs to learn that it is not okay to hit, poke, kick, or pull Lady’s ears or tail. He should also be taught that Lady’s crate is her sanctuary—she is never to be disturbed there. Until he is old enough to understand, it is the responsibility of the supervising adult to prevent Junior from tormenting Lady. • Teach your children basic dog safety tips: • Never approach an unfamiliar dog. • Never run away from a dog. • Never scream near a dog. • Stand still when an unfamiliar dog approaches. • Do not hug a dog unless an adult has told you that you can hug him.\n• Do not stare into a dog’s eyes. • Do not disturb a dog who is sleeping, eating, resting in his crate, or with or near her puppies. • Do not play with a dog unless supervised by an adult.\nChoosing your animal care Association of Pet Dog Trainers (APDT), a nonprofit organization that promotes the use of positive training methods and provides educational opportunities for all trainers to learn more about the modern science of dog behavior and training. You can access the list of APDT member/trainers at the APDT Web site, www.apdt.com, to find an APDT trainer in your geographical area.\nTraining your dog should be fun! A competent instructor will allow and encourage you to observe a class prior to making the decision to enroll. In a well-run class, dogs and people will be enjoying themselves and having a successful learning experience. Look for an instructor who is approachable and who encourages participants to have a good time. If space permits, an instructor should welcome and encourage all family members and others who interact with the dog to attend class.\nA skilled class instructor will Provide a clear explanation of each lesson. Demonstrate the behavior(s) that students will be teaching to their dogs. Provide clear instructions and written handouts on how to teach the behavior(s). Give students ample time in class to begin practicing the day’s lesson. Assist students individually with proper implementation of techniques. 3. A skilled and professional trainer will encourage dialogue and be courteous to both canine and human clients alike. 4. You want to be comfortable with the training tools and methods used by the instructor. A skilled and professional dog trainer employs humane training methods that are not harmful to the dog and/or handler and avoids the practices of hanging, beating, kicking, shocking, and all similar procedures or training devices that could cause the dog great pain or distress, or that have imminent potential for physical harm. You have the absolute right to stop any trainer or other animal-care professional who, in your opinion, is causing your dog undue harm or distress. 5. A conscientious trainer will stay informed about innovations in dog training and behavior tools and techniques. Check to see if the instructor is a member of any\neducational organizations such as the APDT, and whether s/he pursues ongoing educational opportunities. 6. A good instructor will take care to protect your dog’s health in a group setting. Ask if dogs and puppies are required to be vaccinated prior to class and, if so, which vaccines are required. Make sure you and your veterinarian are comfortable with the vaccination requirements. 7. Current clients are a valuable source of information for you. Attending a group class gives you the opportunity to ask clients how they feel about their experience—if they are enjoying the class and feel that their training needs and goals are being met. 8. Because of variables in dog breeding and temperament and owner commitment and experience, a trainer cannot and should not guarantee the results of his/her training. However, an instructor can and should be willing to ensure client satisfaction with his/her professional services.\nTreats and Rewards hot dogs or Vienna sausage (you can microwave them to make them less slimy); various kitty treats; trail mix; frozen Italian meatballs; chopped bologna; peanut butter; cream cheese; small cubes of cheddar cheese; chicken—boiled or, even better, fried; liver—freeze-dried or fried; minced steak or roast beef; and the several brands of meat rolls produced for dogs. Squeeze cheese is a favorite of mine for exceptionally fussy dogs, and baby food in a jar\na spoon or my finger, right out of the jar, or from a squeeze tube\nof French toast, Cheerios, croutons soaked in salad dressing, and cheese-filled tortellini.\nsmall chunks of apple and carrot.\nchocolate and onions can kill a dog if consumed in even moderate quantities. Grapes and raisins have also been implicated in numerous dog deaths.\nLIFE REWARDS things other than food that your dog loves.\nthe more reliably your dog has learned a behavior, the more you can use life rewards in place of treat rewards.\n• Chasing a ball or a Frisbee • Chasing squirrels or birds (in a safe environment) • Going outside or coming inside • Digging a hole • Chewing a chew toy • Playing tug of war or chase • Taking a walk or going for a car ride • Swimming • Playing with other dogs • Anything else your dog loves to do\nTraining Cues All Done : You are released from whatever I was asking you to do.\nWatch Me: Look at me.\nClick (or a mouth click, finger snap, the words “Yes,” “Click,” or “Tick”): What you were doing at the exact moment you heard the click is earning you a food reward.\nCome: Run quickly to me. (You might also want it to mean “and sit right in front of me.”)\nDog’s Name: Look at me and wait for further instructions.\nDown: Lie down on the ground (not get off something or someone).\nExcuse Me: Walk backward.\nGood Boy: General praise—not a reward marker!\nHeel: Walk by my left side with your shoulder even with my knee.\nJackpot: Exceptionally good effort—you are earning extra rewards!\nLeave It: Whatever you are touching or paying attention to, leave it alone; get off someone or something; don’t touch.\nLet’s Walk: Walk with me without pulling on the leash, or walk closely with me with no leash, but not necessarily in the heel position.\nNo: What you are doing is very bad or dangerous—stop immediately! (Use very sparingly, just for life-threatening situations, and when you do use it, say it like you mean it!)\nOops (or Wrong, Mistake, Sorry): The behavior you are doing will not earn you a reward. (This is referred to as a no-reward marker and is also used sparingly.)\nRelax: Lie flat on your side.\nSit (not Sit Down): Put yourself in the sitting position from whatever position you are in now.\nStand: Stand still on all four legs. Stay: Don’t move from the position I left you in until I release you.\nTake It: Take food or an object into your mouth (the beginning of teaching a dog to retrieve).\nTouch: Touch your nose to a designated target. Wait: Pause. Stop moving, either until I leave or until I release you. (This is less formal than stay.)",
