<p>In 2010, I was facing felony charges for distribution of drugs. I was a drug addict. Hook line and sinker. But never admitted that to myself. My drug of choice? Anything I could get my hands on. Cocaine, ecstasy, weed, Xanax, Oxycontin, mushrooms.. You name it.</p>

<p>Desperately wanting to avoid prison time, I did whatever I could to turn my life around. The potential pain in carrying on was too great to tolerate. This was my rock bottom.</p>
<p>I enrolled in college, started working out every day, got rid of any &ldquo;friends&rdquo;  that wanted to continue that lifestyle.</p>
<p>And quitting my daily drug use?</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a factor. I was too scared. I was willing to do anything to escape my prison sentence so I dropped them all without looking back. I was lucky. Lucky I had hit rock bottom. Lucky that everything collapsed around me. I needed a push and this was it.</p>
<p>Apparently the judge saw that I was making real change and I was able to avoid prison. I was slapped with a couple of felonies, fines, and drug and rehab classes.</p>
<p>Having felonies on my record was hard. I couldn&rsquo;t get a decent job. Even Walmart was excited to hire me, but then rejected me because of my record. I knew that I had turned a new leaf. I just needed someone to see that I was changed now.</p>
<p>Luckily, I found a family that needed help with their special needs kid.</p>
<p>I worked for them for long enough to get my felonies expunged off my record.</p>

<h3 id="when-hard-drugs-turn-into-soft-drugs">When hard drugs turn into soft drugs.</h3>
<p>I thought I was &ldquo;drug free&rdquo; because I had stopped all illegal drugs. But soon I found myself consuming copious amounts of caffeine in order to lose weight and get &ldquo;Jacked&rdquo;. You see, I found a passion for natural bodybuilding and Jiu-Jitsu around 2011.</p>
<p>I consumed endless content on how to lose body fat so I could finally get a six pack. A lot of YouTubers at the time were promoting pre-workouts like Jack3d. Which also had another stimulant called 1,3 dimethylamylamine - or DMAA. Which was banned after it had become known to be problematic.</p>
<p>So there I was, taking Jack3d, working out, and trying to figure out how to get a six pack. I hired the same coaches that my favorite YouTuber Matt Ogus had, 3DMuscleJourney. Diet and training really got serious.</p>
<p>When I started with 3D Muscle Journey in 2012, I had been working out for a solid year. I had gotten down to 195lbs from 215. Not a huge difference. And I had put on a good amount of Muscle in that time.</p>
<p>Me at 215</p>

<p>3DMuscleJourney taught me and guided me on how to train effectively while dieting and how to diet efficiently by tracking macros. But my preworkout and caffeine use had spiked up 1,500mg a day. I used caffeine as a substitute for food. After 12 weeks, I was down to 160lbs.</p>

<p>I was fit by any person&rsquo;s definition. My new found glory would soon collapse as my caffeine and DMAA use caught up to me. I started having bad shoulder pain, my joints were achy and cracky, popping every time I moved. I started stretching and doing mobility exercises but the pain in my body only got worse. I was unable to sleep. I would have fits of rage followed by lows of doubt and depression.</p>
<p>Then, I broke. I was no longer able to exercise because of the pain. I started eating more to see if it would help my joints. I quickly gained 30lbs. Probably within only a few weeks. I ended my coaching and started to slip back towards the abyss.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I figured out that caffeine and DMAA were both a huge problem.</p>
<p>I had been consuming caffeine my whole life. But never thought twice about it. It was a legal substance that a kid could go buy in a vending machine. How bad could it be? Broken, I decided to quit.</p>
<p>I was quickly able to cut out DMAA. But every attempt at quitting caffeine left me in so much pain that I would quickly rationalize going back to it. I never made it past two weeks.</p>
<p>Why was this harder than quitting all of those harder drugs?</p>
<p>I guess decades of using a softer drug still carves out some pretty steep ravines in your reward pathway. Caffeine was my last vice.</p>
<p>I read the book &ldquo;Caffeine Blues&rdquo;. This book explained that caffeine is not healthy in any way. It is a stimulant that cause your body to break down over time just like any drug. The book outlned some of the negatives associated with caffeine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Poor sleep, even if you didn&rsquo;t consume caffeine close to bedtime.</li>
<li>Joint pain from increased muscle tension.</li>
<li>Poor vitamin and mineral absorption.</li>
<li>Energy crashes and mood swings.</li>
<li>Irritability.</li>
<li>Psychosis.</li>
<li>Masking negatives of caffeine with drugs and alcohol.</li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on. This was crazy. The booked recommended tapering off of caffeine. While I was able to wean down to 300-600  most days. I started to look at &ldquo;Nootropics&rdquo; to help me focus.</p>
