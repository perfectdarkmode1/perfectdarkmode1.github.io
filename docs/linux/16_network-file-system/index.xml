    <description>Same tools for mounting and unmounting a filesystem.&#xA;Mounted and accessed the same way as local filesystems. Network protocol that allows file sharing over the network. Multi-platform Multiple clients can access a single share at the same time. Reduced overhead and storage cost. Give users access to uniform data. Consolidate scattered user home directories. May cause client to hang if share is not accessible. Share stays mounted until manually unmounted or the client shuts down.</description>
