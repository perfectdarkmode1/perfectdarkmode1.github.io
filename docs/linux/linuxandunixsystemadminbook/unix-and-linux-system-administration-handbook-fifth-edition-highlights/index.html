<h3 id="controlling-access">Controlling access</h3>
<p>creates accounts for new users, removes the accounts of inactive users, and handles all the account-related issues that come up in between</p>
<p>process of actually adding and removing accounts is typically automated by a configuration management system or centralized directory service</p>
<h3 id="adding-hardware">Adding hardware</h3>
<h3 id="automating-tasks">Automating tasks</h3>
<p>increases your efficiency, reduces the likelihood of errors caused by humans, and improves your ability to respond rapidly to changing equirements</p>
<h3 id="overseeing-backups">Overseeing backups</h3>
<p>Backups must be executed on a regular schedule and restores must be tested periodically to ensure that they are functioning correctly.</p>
<h3 id="installing-and-upgrading-software">Installing and upgrading software</h3>
<p>As patches and security updates are released, they must be tested, reviewed, and incorporated into the local environment without endangering the stability of production systems</p>
<p>software delivery” refers to the process of releasing updated versions of software</p>
<p>Continuous delivery” takes this process to the next level by automatically releasing software to users at a regular cadence as it is developed</p>
<h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring</h3>
<p>detecting problems and fixing them before public failures occur.</p>
<p>monitoring tasks include ensuring that web services respond quickly and correctly, collecting and analyzing log files, and keeping tabs on the availability of server resources such as disk space</p>
<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
<h3 id="maintaining-local-documentation">Maintaining local documentation</h3>
<p>Thorough and accurate documentation is a blessing for team members who would otherwise need to reverse-engineer a system to resolve problems in the middle of the night</p>
<h2 id="vigilantly-monitoring-security">Vigilantly monitoring security</h2>
<p>must implement a security policy and set up procedures to prevent systems from being breached</p>
<p>might include only a few basic checks for unauthorized access, or it might involve an elaborate network of traps and auditing programs, depending on the context</p>
<h3 id="tuning-performance">Tuning performance</h3>
<p>tailor systems for optimal performance in accord with the needs of users, the available infrastructure, and the services the systems provide</p>
<p>When a server is performing poorly, it is the administrator’s job to investigate its operation and identify areas that need improvement.</p>
<h3 id="developing-site-policies">Developing site policies</h3>
<p>most sites need policies that govern the acceptable use of computer systems, the management and retention of data, the privacy and security of networks and systems, and other areas of regulatory interest</p>
<p>develop sensible policies that meet the letter and</p>
<p>intent of the law and yet still promote progress and productivity</p>
<h3 id="working-with-vendors">Working with vendors</h3>
<h3 id="fire-fighting">Fire fighting</h3>
<p>your response to these issues affects your perceived value as an administrator far more than does any actual technical skill you might possess a single well-handled trouble ticket scores more brownie points than five hours of midnight debugging</p>
<h3 id="vim">Vim</h3>
<p>Mastering vim is perhaps the single best productivity enhancement available to administrators
Use the vimtutor command for an excellent, interactive introduction.</p>
<h3 id="programming">Programming</h3>
<p>Capable administrators are usually polyglot programmers who don’t mind picking up a new language when the need arises</p>
<p>we recommend Bash (aka bash, aka sh), Ruby, or Python</p>
<p>We also suggest that you learn expect, which is not a programming language so much as a front end for driving interactive programs. It’s an efficient glue technology that can replace some complex scripting and is easy to learn.</p>
<h3 id="distributions">Distributions</h3>
<p>A Linux distribution comprises the Linux kernel, which is the core of the operating system, and packages that make up all the commands you can run on the system</p>
<p>All distributions share the same kernel lineage, but the format, type, and number of packages
differ quite a bit</p>
<p>distributions derived from the Debian and Red Hat lineages will predominate in production environments in the years ahead</p>
<p>Virtually all leading distributions are cluttered with scores of unused software packages; security vulnerabilities and administrative anguish often come along for the ride</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By adopting a distribution, you are making an investment in a
particular vendor’s way of doing things. Instead of looking only at
the features of the installed software, it’s wise to consider how your
organization and that vendor are going to work with each other. Some
important questions to ask are:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Is this distribution going to be around in five years?</li>
<li>Is this distribution going to stay on top of the latest security
patches?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Does this distribution have an active community and sufficient
documentation</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If I have problems, will the vendor talk to me, and how much will that
cost</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A comprehensive list of distributions, including many non-English
distributions, can be found at lwn.net/Distributions or
distrowatch.com</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu Linux, Red</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hat Enterprise Linux (and its dopplegänger CentOS), and FreeBSD</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Debian defines three releases that are maintained simultaneously:
stable, targeting production servers; unstable, with current packages
that may</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>have bugs and security vulnerabilities; and testing, which is
somewhere in between.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ubuntu version numbers derive from the</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>year and month of release, so version 16.10 is from October, 2016.
Each release also has an alliterative code name such as Vivid Vervet
or Wily Werewolf.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Two versions of Ubuntu are released annually: one in April and one in
October. The April releases</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>in even-numbered years are long-term support (LTS) editions that
promise five years of maintenance updates. These are the releases
recommended for production use</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>RHEL is open source but requires a license. If you’re not willing to
pay for the license, you’re not going to be running Red Hat.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fedora, a community-based distribution that serves as an incubator for
bleeding-edge software not considered stable enough for RHEL</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fedora is used as the initial test bed for software and configurations
that later find their way to RHEL</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CentOS is an excellent choice for sites that want to deploy a
production-oriented distribution without paying tithes to Red Hat. A
hybrid approach is also feasible: front-line servers can run Red Hat
Enterprise</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux and avail themselves of Red Hat’s excellent support, even as
nonproduction systems run CentOS</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This arrangement covers the important bases in terms of risk and
support while also minimizing cost and administrative complexity</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CentOS aspires to full binary and bug-for-bug compatibility with Red
Hat Enterprise Linux</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple’s macOS has a BSD heritage</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>FreeBSD</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>commands a 70% market share among BSD variants</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike Linux, FreeBSD is a complete operating system, not just a
kernel</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We use $ to denote the shell prompt for a normal, unprivileged user,
and # for the root user</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>A star (*) matches zero or more characters.</li>
<li>A question mark (?) matches one character.</li>
<li>A tilde or “twiddle” (~) means the home directory of the current
user</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>~user means the home directory of user.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>one “megabyte” of memory is really 220 or 1,048,576 bytes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>RAM is always denominated in powers of 2, but network bandwidth</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is always a power of 10. Storage space is usually quoted in
power-of-10 units, but block and page sizes are in fact powers of 2</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Unit decoding examples</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>see wiki.ubuntu.com/UnitsPolicy for some additional details</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Man pages and other on-line documentatio</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>consult man pages as an authoritative resource because they are
accessible from the command line</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>details on a program’s options, and show helpful examples and related
commands</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>concise descriptions of individual commands, drivers, file formats, or
library routines</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>FreeBSD and Linux divide the man pages into sections.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sections of the man pages</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>be aware of the section definitions when a topic with the same name
appears in multiple sections</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>man title formats a specific manual page and sends it to your terminal
through more, less, or whatever program is specified in your PAGER
environment variable</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>title is usually a command, device, filename, or name of a library
routine</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sections of the manual are searched in roughly numeric order, although
sections that describe commands (sections 1 and 8) are usually
searched first.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>man section title gets you a man page from a particular section</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>man sync gets you the man page for the sync command, and man 2 sync
gets you the man page for the sync system call</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>man -k keyword or apropos keyword prints a list of man pages that have
keyword in their one-line synopses</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The keywords database can become outdated. If you add additional man
pages to your system</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you may need to rebuild this file with makewhatis (Red Hat and
FreeBSD) or mandb (Ubuntu).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>nroff input for man pages (i.e., the man page source code) is stored
in directories under /usr/share/man and compressed with gzip to save
space</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>man maintains a cache of formatted pages in /var/cache/man or
/usr/share/man if the appropriate directories are writable; however,
this is a security risk. Most systems preformat the man pages once at
installation time (see catman) or not at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The man command can search several man page repositories to find the
manual pages you request. On Linux systems, you can find out the
current default search path with the manpath command. This path (from
Ubuntu) is typical</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If necessary, you can set your MANPATH environment variable to
override the default path</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some systems let you set a custom system-wide default search path for
man pages, which can be useful if you need to maintain a parallel tree
of man pages such as those generated by OpenPKG</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Where to find OS</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pro Git from git-scm.com/book make the hunt worthwhile</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Many pieces of software have both a man page and a long-form article</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most software projects have user and developer mailing lists and IRC
channels</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if you have questions</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Request for Comments documents describe the protocols and procedures
used on the Internet</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The phrase “reference implementation” applied to software</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>usually translates to “implemented by a trusted source according to
the RFC specification</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When stuck, search the web.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Resources for keeping up to date</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Social media are also useful. Twitter and reddit in particular have
strong, engaged communities with a lot to offer, though the
signal-to-noise ratio can sometimes be quite bad. On reddit, join the
sysadmin, linux, linuxadmin, and netsec subreddits.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Task-specific forums and reference sites</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Stack Overflow and Server Fault</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s worth creating an account and joining this large community</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Conferences relevant to system administrators</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Meetups (meetup.com) are another way to network and engage with
like-minded people. Most urban areas in the United States and around
the world have a Linux user group or DevOps meetup that sponsors
speakers, discussions, and hack days.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When adding software, don your security hat and remember that
additional software creates additional attack surface</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most software is developed by independent groups that release the
software in the form of source code. Package repositories then pick up
the source code, compile it appropriately for the conventions in use
on the systems they serve, and package the resulting</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>binaries. It’s usually easier to install a system-specific binary
package than to fetch and compile the original source code. However,
packagers are sometimes a release or two behind the current version.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>two systems use the same package format doesn’t necessarily mean that
packages for the two systems are interchangeable</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Red Hat and SUSE both use RPM</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When the packaged format is insufficient, administrators must install
software the old-fashioned way: by downloading a tar archive of the
source code and manually configuring, compiling, and installing it.
Depending on the software and the operating system, this process can
range from trivial to nightmarish</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>use the shell’s which command to find out if a relevant binary is
already</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>reveals that the GNU C compiler has already been installed on this
machine</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If which can’t find the command you’re looking for, try whereis; it
searches a broader range of system directories and is independent of
your shell’s search path</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>locate command, which consults a precompiled index</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the filesystem to locate filenames that match a particular pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>FreeBSD includes locate as part of the base system. In Linux, the
current implementation of locate is in the mlocate package</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On Red Hat</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>and CentOS, install the mlocate package with yum; see this page.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>locate can find any type of file; it is not specific to commands or
packages. For example, if you weren’t sure where to find the signal.h
include file, you could try</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>locate’s database is updated periodically by the updatedb command (in
FreeBSD</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>locate.updatedb), which runs periodically out of cron.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, the results of a locate don’t always reflect recent changes
to the filesystem</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>you can also use your system’s packaging utilities to check directly
for the package’s presence</p>
