    <title>Packages and Their Management - Perfect Dark Mode</title>
    <link>http://localhost:36217/linux/misc_linux/packages/</link>
    <description>Software Distribution&#xA;Packages such as internet browsers, text editors, media players, etc. are managed via package managers that install and maintain the software on the system. Packages can be installed using sources code instead of by a package manager.&#xA;Packages are really just lot and lots of files compiled into one.&#xA;The people who write them are called upstream providers. They send updates to package maintainers who get the software into the hands of the users.</description>
