<p>Sex drive is a powerful force. And misusing it brings you down to the level of an animal. You must conserve and transmute this force to reveal your true gifts. Feeding lust makes your never satisfied, and spills over into all other areas in life.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Thousand petalled lotus of man's astral and physical brain, unique
if he ever broke the prime law given to him by the Creator, and descended to the lower chakras, and began to propagate in the animal
way, his sexual nature would be completely unregulated.</p>
<p>Become addicted to sex, and begin to propagate.</p>
<p>Drawing him into the delusion that the dream is real, and important.</p>
<p>Female who has had intercourse has witnessed the noticeable change in
mood, lack of interest, and marked withdrawal following the male
discharge. It happens right away. He becomes a different man. The
glint is now gone from his eye. He turns away from her in the bed.</p>
<p>Qualities of nobility, patience, magnanimity, energy, and strength
accrue in men who conserve their shakti.</p>
<p>Men would be kinder to their children and have more patience with them.</p>
<p>Once a month is nature's maximum for the male. Any more orgasms than
that makes the male PSYCHOLOGICALLY INFERIOR to the female.</p>
<p>The deposit of the man's pearls into the woman actually is of great physical and psychological benefit to the female</p>
<p>The male sexual energy is the cornerstone of a man's psychological
resilience and his character</p>
<p>The female is having to grab the wheel of the Tenth House.</p>
<p>In doing so, she has to also try to be at the helm in the Fourth
House, where she always used to prosper, and having to do both, she
does them badly.</p>
<p>With knowledge and cultivation, men can come back into their true
power, stop our &quot;fall,&quot; and bring back the Garden of Eden, day by
day, by degrees.</p>
<p>We are talking about giving his patience back. Getting his steadiness
of mind back. Getting his nobility and fidelity back. Getting his calm
and generosity back. Getting rid of his neediness and thralldom to
sex.</p>
<p>Charms, powers, and psychological improvements that descend upon the
male who begins to respect his divine shakti, even by making a
moderate attempt at restraint, say, cutting his orgasms in half.</p>
<p>The greatness of a man depends completely on the degree of his ability
to keep the First Law, and his Effort to keep the First Law.</p>
<p>Even when he fails, the man or woman who makes the effort, and holds
to the ideal, is better than the one who says that there is no ideal,
or that no effort needs to be made.</p>
<p>No man is great who doesn't have righteous control of his sexual
energy.</p>
<p>His ability to be moral in other ways depends on this.</p>
<p>No good influence, whether moral, intellectual, or spiritual, is
effected by a man or woman lacking righteous self control. They have
only destructive influence in the world. Because sexual purity is
practically everything.</p>
<p>Crass, gross thrill that has nothing to do with you, and no compare
with Divine Bliss.</p>
<p>Aspirant may finally adopt pure celibacy without strain.</p>
<p>Essential meaning of celibacy is: A period in which there is no loss
of the creative substance, including the finer substance.</p>
<p>Refraining from conscious sexual thrills or indulgence involving the
sexual organ while in the waking state, even if there is no loss of
semen.</p>
<p>Even one month of celibacy gives permanent, eternal effect.</p>
<p>Sex desire is bondage.</p>
<p>Will invent endless rationales for keeping their addiction going, as
well as encouraging others to be addicted, both for their own lustful
stimulation, as well as to provide for themselves a validating
environment.</p>
<p>Empty, fruitless sensual pleasure that entangles you deeper into
matter.</p>
<p>Even the absence of lustful thoughts.</p>
<p>Celibacy State 1: Celibacy Under Vows</p>
<p>One soldier has &quot;burned the bridge behind him&quot; as he marches to the
battle; the other soldier leaves the bridge there, but is still
marching nevertheless.</p>
<p>Men should be encouraged toward the many grades of restraint without
thinking they have signed up for The Death Of All Pleasure.</p>
<p>Better health &ndash;More energy &ndash;Less need for sleep &ndash;More power to manifest thoughts.</p>
<p>&ndash;Deeper meditation &ndash;More wealth</p>
<p>Sex is a force of nature, but it is nota &quot;human need.</p>
<p>Attain authority over forces of nature.</p>
<p>Sex appetite is insatiable, has no end, and leads man down to the
nature of a demon.</p>
<p>Sex is for making babies. It wasn't intended for anything else. It
wasn't intended as a drug to make you feel better, or take away your
pain for a moment.</p>
<p>It wasn't meant as a way for you to build up your social power, give
you influence over ignorant men, or get you baubles and dollars from them.</p>
<p>It wasn't meant as a way to get famous, make money, or sell
entertainment.</p>
<p>Not meant to give you the fleeting impression of &quot;bonding&quot; with
someone.</p>
<p>You do have a need for that increased vitality, strength and endurance.</p>
<p>Need for the evenness and patience that restraint will give you.</p>
<p>Need for knowledge, which builds up like compound interest in the
celibate.</p>
<p>Need for meditation, which is stabilized by celibacy.</p>
<p>Need for enlightenment, which will be made possible through your
celibacy.</p>
<p>Stop losing your vital force.</p>
<p>Bogus &quot;tantra&quot; people like to claim that they are &quot;including the
world&quot; in their definition of the divine.</p>
<p>Renounce sin and sexuality because it disturbs us; it takes away our
peace.</p>
<p>It draws our shakti down the spine, and out into materiality, in fact
giving the outer world its seeming reality.</p>
<p>The more that married couples sex each other, the higher the divorce
rate in a nation.</p>
<p>There is no higher bonding brought by sexing. It is simply using each
other as a drug.</p>
<p>The more men and women sex each other, the more they violate their own
sacredness, cheapen their relationship, and lose respect for one
another.</p>
<p>Higher bonding comes from respect for each other's good character.</p>
<p>Divine friendship.</p>
<p>Friendship is the highest form of all human relationship.</p>
<p>Practices. Through spiritual practices such as meditation, all
material addictions decline and then disappear.</p>
<p>Meditation is the greatest cure for all addictions, including sexual
addiction.</p>
<p>One of the reasons it works is simply that meditation and intense
prayer bring a superior pleasure. There is no comparison between the
pleasure of meditation, and the sense pleasures of the body.</p>
<p>Satvic qualities, service to mankind, and charisma &ndash; all of which arise naturally from firm celibacy.</p>
<p>If you repeatedly break moral law concerning sex, your life becomes
darker and less successful on all levels.</p>
<p>Most human sorrow, and all human sexual perversion is the result of repeatedly breaking sexual moral law and indulging in illicit sex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For there are eunuchs who were born thus from their mother's womb,
and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are
eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom
of heaven. He who is able to accept it, let him accept it.&rdquo; -Jesus Christ</p>
<p>But this is a hard statement, and few can bear it.</p>
<p>Kingdom of Heaven&quot; means the limitless bliss of the Pure
Consciousness.</p>
<p>The &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; is something we are bid to attain here and
now in this very life.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to achieve celibacy if you drink any caffeine
&ndash; even a little bit.</p>
<p>Another quote from Christ that relates to celibacy: &quot;Unless you
become as little children you cannot enter the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
<p>By keeping the mind on lofty thoughts, and by strenuous exercise,
continuous action for God, and meditation, the sacred and powerful creative force can be transmuted into physical strength and health, mental creativity, and divine ecstasy in God-communion.</p>
<p>Virtue brings beauty, sin brings ugliness.</p>
<p>&quot;Yoga&quot; actually means &quot;union&quot; with the divine.</p>
<p>&quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; by Patanjali.</p>
<p>An austerity is a &quot;doing without.&quot; Austerity and Renunciation are
synonymous terms and there is no confusion about them.</p>
<p>Buddha was a Hindu. The books he read were the Bhagavad-Gita and the
Vedas.</p>
<p>No one who is spiritual is without austerity.</p>
<p>Self restraints, fixed observances, posture, regulation of breath,
abstraction, concentration, contemplation, trance are the eight parts
of yoga.</p>
<p>The Science of Yoga, The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali with Commentary by I.K. Taimni, p. 205.</p>
<p>One of the self restraints is called &quot;bramacharya.&quot;: 30. &quot;Ahimsa
(Non-Injury), Satya (Truth), Asteya (Abstention From Stealing),
Bramacharya (Continence) and Aparigraha Abstinence From Avariciousness are the Five Yamas (Forms Of Restraint).</p>
<p>Sanskrit, which is the oldest language.</p>
<p>Sanskrit is a very exacting language not subject to playful
interpretation.</p>
<p>Bramacharya refers to one thing, and one thing only: sexual celibacy.</p>
<p>Bramacharya means: no orgasms, at minimum.</p>
<p>Broader meaning is no thought of sex or sexual titillation.</p>
<p>If you are an earnest brahmachari, who is going deeper, you don't
look at the rear ends of women as they go by.</p>
<p>You don't feel a drop in your private parts when you look at a woman;
you don't imagine having sex with any woman, etc.</p>
<p>On being firmly established in sexual continence vigor (virya) is
attained.</p>
<p>Weakness, laxity and inadequacy disappear and are replaced by
extraordinary resilience, strength and energy.</p>
<p>So that not the slightest thought or desire connected with sex or
suggesting sex ever enters the mind.</p>
<p>Bramacharya is, therefore&hellip;a control of the thoughts so complete that
not the slightest stirring of our sex instincts is possible at any
time.</p>
<p>&quot;Yoga Vasistha,&quot; by the sage Vasistha, is one of the most valuable
books on yoga.</p>
<p>Woe unto him who is unable to give up cravings, for this is the sole
means to one's ultimate good.</p>
<p>He who does not allow his mind to roam in objects of sense pleasure is
able to master it [his mind].</p>
<p>Lovingly, patiently wean yourself away from sense addictions.</p>
<p>What they do is weaken gullible males, making them craven sex-addicts,
but now with delusional notions that keep them trapped.</p>
<p>Sex-addicted men do not win wars, or even battles, nor can they even
mount effective resistance.</p>
<p>Perfect continence is the sole condition of success in spiritual life.
And it is difficult, no, it is impossible, to practice absolute purity
without love and faith in God.</p>
<p>Banish all fear and weakness. Never weaken your mind by thinking of
past mistakes.</p>
<p>Never lose faith in yourself. The Lord will do everything for you.
Have faith in Him.</p>
<p>From lust comes grief, from lust comes fear; he who is free from lust
neither sorrows nor fears.</p>
<p>If a man's thoughts are free from lust, if his mind is not perplexed.</p>
<p>The thirst of a heedless man grows like a creeper; he runs from life to life, like a monkey seeking fruit in the forest.</p>
<p>Sufferings fall from him like water drops from a lotus leaf.</p>
<p>Called a medicant (sanyyasin).</p>
<p>He who, though richly adorned, exercises tranquillity, is quiet,
subdued, restrained, chaste, and has ceased to injure all other
beings, is indeed a Brahman, an ascetic, a friar.</p>
<p>There are no satisfying lusts.</p>
<p>Ever by a shower of gold pieces; he who knows that lusts have a short
taste and bring suffering in their train is wise.</p>
<p>Four things befall the heedless man who courts his neighbor's wife &ndash;
first, acquisition of demerit, secondly, an uncomfortable bed,
thirdly, evil report, and lastly, hell.</p>
<p>The type of Buddhism spreading most in America is Tibetan Buddhism, or
&quot;Tantric Buddhism&quot;.</p>
<p>Any sexual self restraint has great benefits to man morally, emotionally, and physically, and conduces to all prosperity.</p>
<p>Engine of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Makes possible the deeper meditation.</p>
<p>Steadies the mind.</p>
<p>Any sexual self-restraint&quot; gives &quot;great benefits&quot; to man.</p>
<p>It is more difficult to attain celibacy and sexual self restraint for a
male.</p>
<p>When he attains it, the effects on him are immediately greater.</p>
<p>In bodily terms, the woman is the actual winner in the sex act; the
male is the actual loser.</p>
<p>When you become entirely devoted to the Lord of Creation, All of
creation becomes devoted to you.</p>
<p>In the spiritual path, one disengages from grosser pleasures so that
one can experience pleasures that are finer and more satisfying.</p>
<p>The one thing worth attaining.</p>
<p>Increased energy and greater powers of concentration.</p>
<p>To be oppressive toward others in the attempt to make them &quot;pure&quot; is
ignorant and itself impure.</p>
<p>Proper attitude one should have toward wickedness is to ignore it,
while praising the virtuous.</p>
<p>Celibacy has always been, and still is, essential to classical yoga.</p>
<p>The sanskrit term for sexual celibacy is bramacharya. For a man it
means no emission of sexual fluid. This is the minimum meaning for
celibacy. Celibacy has been broken, for example, if a man has an orgasm in sleep.</p>
<p>He fully burns up all thoughts of sex, starting with the gross
physical mind, and then later cleaning up his dream states and astral
mind.</p>
<p>Yogananda states that meditation is the highest of all the austerities.</p>
<p>The renunciation of harmful food, useless diversions, fruitless pleasures.</p>
<p>She seems to lack his energy, intrepidness, intelligence, skill, and
courage.</p>
<p>When he first finds attraction to another female, again, it is to the
eyes and face. His shakti dwells in the higher part of the spine.</p>
<p>The orgasm has indeed made him less interested in society, less able
to deal with the stresses of other people, and even antisocial.</p>
<p>He can fill up this strange new emptiness with a distraction or thrill.</p>
<p>Divine Shakti becomes insulted and angry seeing herself &quot;dumped on
the ground&quot; for no procreative purpose. She regrets that she gave
that boy the sexual organ and the sexual power of the male. The Divine Shakti begins taking steps to mess up the boy's life, and darken his world.</p>
<p>As the boy keeps sexing, a coarse energy or pollution gathers in his
lower chakras, casting a blight on his outer world.</p>
<p>If he doesn't have clear moral teachings or guidance on this subject, from people he loves and respects, he won't adequately reject this activity and will be tempted to do it again.</p>
<p>Other men, especially males, are in the best position to protect him
here. Without clear warnings and teachings/dharma from another male he respects, he does it again and begins to develop an addiction to it.</p>
<p>First he had no interest in the idea of the sex act. In fact as a boy
the sex act seemed stupid and disgusting. But now it is interesting
and the idea gives a sexual charge.</p>
<p>This marks him, giving him powerful samskaras (memories/impressions) of sex. Later as he tries to renounce, these impressions will become deeply problematic. The memories of sex will keep coming back to him, inciting his lust.</p>
<p>His eyes now have the habit of looking at the bodies of women and
lusting.</p>
<p>The male developing sex addiction is always drawn to look at the
bodies of women. Women on the street, women at school, women at work, etc.</p>
<p>But now his consciousness is dropping lower. In society, this causes
women to become preoccupied with a new part of her body, her butt.</p>
<p>Women in more pure societies are never obsessed about their butts.</p>
<p>You can tell where a society is at in it's decline by which part of the anatomy the female is most obsessed about.</p>
<p>The male becomes powerless in his reaction to the female form.</p>

<p>Every time he sees the female form, in photos or it life, he is
intensely drawn to it. The female body has a seemingly magical hold
over him, and his response to the female form is intense.</p>
<p>The female form becomes his true idol, his de facto god.</p>
<p>He is easily irritated, and easily loses his temper, especially after
an orgasm.</p>
<p>Powers of focus and concentration lessen.</p>
<p>Becomes less competent and energetic in discharging his duties.</p>
<p>He has less patience and operates from a lower morale.</p>
<p>He is more likely to get into conflicts and arguments with others, and
operate from a less noble emotional position.</p>
<p>He performs more other deeds which are unvirtuous, destructive, or
negative.</p>
<p>Listless and lacks sparkle. He lacks energy. &ndash;He is sick more. He may
develop a chronic health problem.</p>
<p>Usually the sexing man comes to be more comfortable relating to women,
and is uncomfortable with men.</p>
<p>Feels uncomfortable getting close to men, and avoids men as friends.</p>
<p>Men no longer appeal as companions, because he relates to others
mostly with a sexual charge, and he has become so sexualized that it
begins to respond to strange things, as if sexual desire had an
omnivorous appetite.</p>
<p>You can usually tell a man who is fairly sexually clean, because he
will have close non sexual male relationships, even preferring to be with men, with no sexual thing at all.</p>
<p>He begins to find himself attracted to things in the woman that did not have a sexual meaning before.</p>
<p>He is about to take the path of the demon, who is destined to be made
fertilizer by the Divine Being.</p>
<p>A sexual thrill will begin to develop around increasingly perverse and
disturbing things. With each new collapse, he yields something more in
the realm of his conscience and values.</p>
<p>He may still retain the same beliefs about right or wrong. But he
violates his own principles in pursuit of the drug. So he may
eventually be led into homosexuality, blood, violence, and other evil
things as he cultivates them as sources of a fresh sexual thrill. This is the beginning of the development of &quot;blood lust,&quot; which necessarily arises eventually out of sexual
indulgence.</p>
<p>Man either moves into the darkness of sexual perversion, or realizes
where he is headed and turns back in the direction of his original
purity.</p>
<p>Most effective technique for regaining this lost purity is outright
sexual renunciation, along with deep meditation.</p>
<p>Meditation is critically important, because it gives a more-than-ample
replacement of the lost pleasure when pursued devoutly.</p>
<p>Steps along the way as he reverses his path:</p>
<p>Conscious realization that what he is doing is wrong and destructive
in his life. &ndash;He has become aware of becoming in some way sexually
corrupted or perverted. &ndash;He realizes he is addicted and begins to
seek for help in some form.</p>
<p>It is good for the male to ask, in a conscious way, a higher power to intervene and assist him in overcoming the addiction.</p>
<p>The higher power might be termed God, Jesus Christ, or another guru.
&ndash; He makes a statement to himself of renunciation. Like a smoker who
throws all his cigarettes in the sewer, he accomplishes an act of
renunciation.</p>
<p>Begins to make an effort not to look at sexual things, read sexual
things, or listen to sexual things, or go to women where does sexual things. &ndash;Because of this effort he reduces his orgasms, but he will probably continue to slip regularly. When he does slip, he feels increasing remorse and disgust with himself. He prays more about the problem.</p>
<p>If the man is fortunate, he will find activities that substitute for the pleasure being given up. He will begin to turn the energy now saved to more constructive and positive activities. This may be involvement with people or service. It may be one of the arts. He may throw himself into writing a book, or reading and learning He may get obsessed with his car or some other vehicle, or
begin some new interest. If he is very fortunate, he will discover meditation. This will eventually completely short circuit the sex addiction.</p>
<p>As he sexes less, any trend toward perversion begins to recede. He
strips back the years and regains his more simple, healthy sexual
interests.</p>
<p>Things that were once gross but had become interesting, now are gross
and repugnant again. &ndash;Small and wholesome matters become sexually attractive again, such as the sight of a woman's calf, or the shape of her bust, or her downy cheek/</p>
<p>Restraint. &ndash;He feels more sexually potent, and the attraction to women at times is quite strong. This occasionally causes him to slip again. As a once sexually active man attempts restraint, he naturally builds up a higher level of sexual potential than back.</p>
<p>He comes into states in which he feels more potent than ever.</p>
<p>At times, as this energy is building up but not transmuted, he feels so virile he thinks he could be a veritable stag, mating with many women. He can find sexual attraction to even the plainest of women at these times. He feels like his sexual energy is some kind of boon or precious gift he has to bestow. (This is true, but he should not let it trick him into the Deed.)</p>
<p>This is a lot of fun for him to feel this potent, so he will occasionally slip. Like a sailor who has been away at sea for months, sex desire becomes keen again, and he will at times savor it
and &quot;ride&quot; it as he once did when he was younger and becoming addicted.</p>
<p>This is a mistake, but most men will go through phases like this. The stored up sexual energy is still inclined to want to go down through the lower.</p>
<p>He is trying to pen up a wild stallion that is used to running free. He has a tiger in the barn, and for a period it seems to be problematic.</p>
<p>Eventually the horse will be like a powerful, disciplined draft horse that can be applied to any task.</p>
<p>But during the beginning, the horse wants to bolt a lot. Because of the storing of the sexual energy, any fanning of the flame makes the man feel extremely passionate desire. What he has inside him seems more powerful than before.</p>
<p>With cultivation the tiger will become calm and serve you.</p>
<p>(Thinks that) Celibacy must be impossible or bad. It makes men very horny.&quot; But the fellow is only in an unbaked stage of unskilled celibacy.</p>
<p>The man has a long way to go yet. When he does slip, he will feel more remorse than ever.</p>
<p>And like an alcoholic, he will also find that he sinks to the old depths rather quickly. Whereas his sexual appetite had seemed so wholesome, now a perverse thought reappears. This happens after a slip. Channels have been &quot;cut&quot; in the body, brain, and astral body by the addiction and experiences of the past. These channels are still fresh. Weeds may be growing up in what was once a highway, but the path is still there. In Hinduism these impressions or markings are called &quot;samskaras.&quot; If you scratch a mark in the ground, water will tend to find that channel and flow
down it.</p>
<p>Just abstaining and letting them lie fallow for a while doesn't erase them. They are quickly reclaimed and reactivated with every lapse back into sexing.</p>
<p>There will be lapses. But the wise man steels his continues to cultivate himself away from sexing. &ndash;He may find he can will the sexual energy to bolt up up his spine. When doing so, his spine will bolt erect, as if his whole upper body had become an
erection. &ndash;He stops looking at the butts of women and their other physical features. When he does look, he feels a little disappointed by what he sees.</p>
<p>It's just the same old butt. He starts to think, &quot;You see one,
you've seen them all.&quot;</p>
<p>His most tempting sexual encounters begin to be in the dream state. He sees fewer women who attract him.</p>
<p>As he begins to purify himself of lust, he begins to sense lust in others.</p>
<p>Most women begin to seem used and soiled, or having lust. He senses
these things by instinct.</p>
<p>Because he is becoming pure, he notices the impurity in others.</p>
<p>He finds that he is only attracted to those with some purity.</p>
<p>He no longer consciously masturbates; only in near sleep or sleep states.</p>
<p>He becomes keenly aware of how any loss of semen weakens him physically and demoralizes him. &ndash;He may masturbate consciously or semi-consciously, but endeavors not to &quot;leak&quot; any semen.</p>
<p>He may experiment with Taoist&quot; sexual practices in which sexual pleasure is indulged, but semen is retained or drawn back in. These cause harm to the sexual organs such as the prostate, plus keep him sexing and addicted to the thrill.</p>
<p>He sees how even the mental activity of lusting is vitiating and drains him of shakti.</p>
<p>He senses how even when he looks at a woman with lust, he is losing
subtle shakti.</p>
<p>Now we have a man capable of becoming that jewel among men, the celibate.</p>
<p>Virya refers to noticeable qualities of character and countenance that come to the celibate male (In some Sutra translations the English word &quot;vigor&quot; is used instead).</p>
<p>Virya means the increase of masculine qualities such as strength, stamina, energy, clarity, patience and evenness.</p>
<p>His body, face and attitude.</p>
<p>He wins wars, and protects others who are more vulnerable. Virility
also makes a man unafraid.</p>
<p>Art of War&quot; there is given this interesting strategy for winning a war: Send prostitutes into the enemy camp.</p>
<p>Sturdy, intrepid, and forceful.</p>
<p>The first evidence of a man's progress in spiritual life is a strong
grit.</p>
<p>What &quot;grit&quot; means: Firmness of character, especially in pain or danger.</p>
<p>Unrestrained and wanton sex destroys the character of man and takes away his courage.</p>
<p>Tejas (effulgence) Tejas refers to the sparkle in the eyes and, the glow of vitality, and charismatic aura around the face and body of a celibate saint or yogi.</p>
<p>You are sick less often. Many health problems will be mitigated, or disappear entirely. You need less sleep.</p>
<p>Develop a more even temperament.</p>
<p>Few things irritate you or cause you to lose your temper.</p>
<p>You are bolder, more courageous, and show integrity.</p>
<p>Develop consistency of character and more constancy in pursuing goals.</p>
<p>Even begin controlling &quot;wet dreams&quot;</p>
<p>Out in the world, you rarely see any female who has any sexual
attraction to you.</p>
<p>When any come close to attracting you, it will always be a woman who is herself developing moral purity.</p>
<p>You no longer create sexual experiences in the dream state. One begins to see the female form in a different way.</p>
<p>You begin seeing that almost all women assume males are no better than dogs, that all men inherently worship the female form, and that men are generally unable to resist any woman who gives them half a chance.</p>
<p>Women who are conventionally &quot;sexy&quot; will not attract this sort of man unless they have high moral virtue similar to his.</p>
<p>So it is that as men return to purity and goodness, women automatically follow.</p>
<p>Others notice you and are attracted to you more than before, especially women.</p>
<p>Happens to be attracted to the stored up sexual energy itself, which
provides greater temptations to the celibate, and to her.</p>
<p>As a man withdraws energy from the lower centers and the sexual organ, sometimes a buzzing or vibrating sensation can be felt in the sexual members. This carries no erotic or sexual feeling.</p>
<p>This is the divine shakti knocking off layers of dark karma associated with that organ.</p>
<p>You stop having erections, even in the dream state.</p>
<p>Requires abstention from all caffeine.</p>
<p>A sign of spiritual development is a more pleasant and attractive voice.</p>
<p>Your words are found to have more effect. Your thoughts are found to influence your surroundings. People who spend time around you become more like you. Whatever spiritual realization you have, you become able to pass it to others.</p>
<p>One result is usually a heightened interest in God and pursuit of the spiritual life.</p>
<p>Even a celibate man who is not a God-seeker will influence others powerfully through his thoughts.</p>
<p>The buildup of the male energy, manifests as more energy.</p>
<p>Endurance, steadiness, toughness, and courage &ndash; in all areas of life.</p>
<p>Wasting of the male substance eventually makes a man weak, listless,
timid, and feminine.</p>
<p>Place in the human brain associated with sexual orgasm. This area lies
next to the part of the brain associated with violent aggression. As
the sexer repeatedly &quot;overheats&quot; this part of the brain, it begins to fuse with the violent-aggressive part of the brain. Thus the sexer eventually finds that he is getting erections at the sight of blood and violence. We have a term from deep in our cultural history:
&quot;blood lust&quot;.</p>
<p>Even it a man be the greatest of sinners; even if he has murdered an entire village, and all of its inhabitants were righteous. Still by the boat of meditation this man is purified, accounted good, and cometh to Me.</p>
<p>Desire for celibacy does not often emerge in the female as compellingly as in a man who finally figures out the situation. First of all, sex desire tends not to become such a problem for the female,
causing such negative consequences.</p>
<p>Any man who sexes more than once a month is automatically inferior to any woman.</p>
<p>A female yogi directing her shakti up the spine over a long time will eventually cease from having her period.</p>
<p>Many great female saints having the highest station of nirvikalpa samadhi. Examples: St. Teresa of Avila, Ananda Mayi Ma, the living saint Karuna Mayi.</p>
<p>The man is inherently rajasic, pushing outward and also manifests his
spiritual progress more noticeably in the external realm.</p>
<p>Typical Male Weaknesses &ndash;Addiction to the Female Form; tendency to become addicted to sex &ndash;Lack Of interest in the spiritual and esoteric &ndash;Addiction to activity and worldly pursuits, Overly aggressive, combative nature.</p>
<p>Hurtfulness towards others which clouds his karma and hides from him the spiritual truth &ndash;Pride, ego, arrogance, lack of humility.
&ndash;Fruitless intellectuality; tendency to become distracted by too many
facts, details, and fine distinctions, Difficulty grasping the broad, ineffable, inarticulate sense of things &ndash;Enjoyment of arguing
over spiritual things; lording spiritual knowledge over others &ndash;Less
capacity for trust and Faith (shraddha) &ndash;More distance from the
childlike consciousness &ndash;Less tendency for emotion and devotion
(bhakti) &ndash;Tendency</p>
<p>to believe in only external things &ndash;Tendency to view external things
as more important, including in external things in the spiritual and
religious fields. The male in the leader in the attraction to
worldliness.</p>
<p>tendency to silence, economy of words, which conserves his life force
and reduces his entanglements, improving his sadhana</p>
<p>When the male, for a long time, worships the female form, the female
till necessarily come to worship her own form</p>
<p>Woman has long been dismayed, bemused and even confused by the power
of her body to hold such sway over the male</p>
<p>nothing in the material world, and no sensual feeling, can ever
satisfy man because man is Spirit</p>
