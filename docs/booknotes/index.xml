    <title>Book Notes - Perfect Dark Mode</title>
    <link>http://perfectdarkmode.com/booknotes/</link>
    <description>These are the summaries and notes of books I have read. These notes are the result of wanting to further process books and retain information. After years of reading books one time and then forgetting most of them.&#xA;My current reading process Give the book a quick read through. Read the book a second time, highlighting anything I want to remember along the way. Read through highlights and try to distill key points in my own words, or just writing down words straight from the book that I want to remember.</description>
