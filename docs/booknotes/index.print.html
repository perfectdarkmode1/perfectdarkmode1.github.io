<p>This second half of the book was almost an identical copy of the second half of the book. But still filled with solid advice on establishing a vision, settings goals, measuring the effectiveness of your actions, and other tidbits about being effective and taking action.</p>
<p>I have been implementing most of this and needed to go back through to make sure I&rsquo;ve got down the process.</p>
<p>I highly advise you make your own outline so you do not have to read everything &ldquo;twice again&rdquo;. <a href="/booknotes/the_12_week_year/">Read my notes</a></p>

<h1 id="the-3-jobs-for-you-as-a-parent">The 3 jobs for you as a parent</h1>
<ol>
<li>Control obnoxious Behavior (STOP behaviors)</li>
<li>Encourage good behavior (START behaviors)</li>
<li>Strengthening your relationship with your children</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="controlling-obnoxious-behavior-stop-behaviors">Controlling obnoxious behavior (STOP Behaviors)</h1>
<p>This is where counting and break times come in. You will use counting and break times for STOP behaviors.</p>
<h2 id="taking-breaks-and-counting">Taking Breaks and Counting</h2>
<p>A break is when parents and child can separate briefly so they can calm down and regroup. You do not talk about the behavior after the break. No need to punish the child twice. If the behavior was dangerous, unusual, or new, then give a brief explanation.</p>
<p>3 counts are needed before a break occurs. And after you&rsquo;ve tried ignoring, sympathetic listening, distraction, and joint problem solving.</p>
<p>You and your child may fall for the arguing/ yelling/ hitting/ persuading/ defending/ rationalizing trap. You need to start counting before this happens. Once you notice that you&rsquo;ve fallen in this trap. Simply go back to counting.</p>
<p>The parents tone should not be anger/ negative. It should simply be &ldquo;I love you but you simply cannot behave this way&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="straight-to-3">Straight to 3!</h2>
<p>Major behavior goes straight to 3 and taking a break. This is stuff like hitting, spitting, etc. Still, you must be gentle and consistent. Then the child&rsquo;s behavior will mature over time.</p>
<p>Your child won&rsquo;t behave rationally when they are upset. Same goes to you! The brain is just not wired that way. When dealing with a child, you must manage the yelling/ screaming/ whining/ fighting. All while encouraging positive behaviors like eating, doing homework, cleaning up, going to bed and child/parent bonding.</p>
<p>To be an effective parent you must be gentle and friendly. The message your child receives should be that you love them and will take care of them.</p>
<p>You must also balance this with being firm and letting them know that you expect them to do something.</p>
<p>Children also will model your behavior. Like if you solve problems with anger. They will to. If you are calm and collected. They will learn that from you as well.</p>
<h2 id="counting-is-for-stop-behaviors">Counting is for STOP behaviors</h2>
<p>You must control negative behaviors. These are things you want your children to STOP doing. And what you will use COUNTING for.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Physical attacks on people , breaking something, fighting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teasing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whining</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Temper (intimidation, &ldquo;I HATE YOU!&rdquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arguing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Badgering (wearing you down with repetition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tantrums</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yelling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Threat (I&rsquo;m running away from home)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Martyrdom (&ldquo;I never get anything&rdquo;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crying, pouting, looking sad on purpose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saying something is unfair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Butter up &ldquo;you are the nicest dad in the world!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promises/ insincere apologies</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is controlling obnoxious behavior. Or the demanding side of parenting. This teaches you and your child to hold back and avoid dysfunctional responses.</p>
<p>Methods for stop behaviors</p>
<h3 id="counting">Counting</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go straight to 3 if behavior is dangerous or extreme</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t talk or get angry, just count</li>
<li>Voice should be casual but stern</li>
<li>No extra talking or emotion</li>
<li>Things should go back to normal after a count</li>
<li>Counting with anger is challenging your child to misbehave</li>
<li>Both parents can be involved in any of the counts (mom says 1 for first offense dad says 2, etc.)</li>
<li>Keep quit and ignore for minor offenses (depending on your fuse)</li>
<li>When in doubt count</li>
<li>Take about 5 seconds between counts</li>
<li>Start the counting cycle over longer as the child gets older. (15 minutes for 5 year old, 2-3 hours for an 11 year old, etc.</li>
<li>Do not punish bad grades, use the reward system for grades instead.</li>
<li>Explain to child the counting process when you first start.</li>
<li>Should not be used for bedtime</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="break-time">Break time</h3>
<ol>
<li>One minute per year of the child&rsquo;s life</li>
<li>Do not make eye contact or talk to child</li>
<li>Remain gentle but firm and instructive</li>
<li>You do not have to close the door</li>
<li>No lectures, explanations, or emotions after a break time</li>
<li>Explanations are appropriate when the behavior is new, unusual, or dangerous</li>
<li>Very gentle procedure to calm everyone down</li>
<li>If child behaves, praise him and enjoy his company, if they do something else that is countable, count it.</li>
<li>Parent should not be furious, yelling, lecturing, or physical or emotionally abusive</li>
<li>Most failures are because the parent forgets the no talking and no emotion rules</li>
<li>Timer doesn&rsquo;t start until child is done with tantrum (unless they are 3 or younger, then just let them out when their time is up, start the count over if they continue to misbehave after they get out)</li>
<li>Child can go to room and read, take a nap, play legos, draw, etc. No phone, no friends, and no electronic entertainment.</li>
<li>Use same strategy if company is over</li>
<li>Send kid and friend outside if they both get counted to 3</li>
<li>Give child a hug after break time if they want one.</li>
<li>Should happen right when the offense happens. Do not give a break time an hour later for something. If you can&rsquo;t give a breaktime right away then use a breaktime alternative.</li>
</ol>
<p>What if kids won&rsquo;t go to break time?</p>
<ol>
<li>Bring them to the room</li>
<li>Choose a breaktime Alternative (you can give them a choice between a couple consequences, you pick if they won&rsquo;t)</li>
<li>Reverse break time, you leave the room, walk around the house, don’t talk</li>
<li>If they won&rsquo;t come out of breaktime, that is okay, just tell them when their time is up</li>
</ol>
<p>What if they leave their room?</p>
<ol>
<li>Add extra time</li>
<li>Switch to break time alternative</li>
<li>Doorknob cover</li>
<li>Locking the door</li>
<li>Tell them if they come out then the door gets closed</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="break-time-alternatives">Break Time Alternatives</h3>
<p>Make sure these are fair and reasonable. And that the punishment fits the behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li>Loss of privilege or toy for a period of time</li>
<li>bedtime fifteen minutes earlier</li>
<li>forty cents off the allowance</li>
<li>no electronic entertainment for two hours</li>
<li>Earlier bedtime</li>
<li>No dessert or treat</li>
<li>No use of phone</li>
<li>No friend over</li>
<li>No conversation—fifteen minutes</li>
<li>Removal of DVD, iPod</li>
<li>Reduced computer time</li>
<li>Loss of TV for evening</li>
<li>Loss of electronic games—two hours</li>
<li>Monetary fine</li>
<li>Small chore—wash bathroom sink</li>
<li>Larger chore—weed yard</li>
<li>Write a paragraph</li>
<li>(Limited only by your imagination)</li>
</ul>
<p>Child has a fit when dropping off at daycare.</p>
<p>Become master of the quick exit. Kiss goodbye, tell them when you&rsquo;ll see them again, and get out of there. The more you talk, the worse you will make the situation.</p>
<p>Sibling rivalry</p>
<p>never ask &ldquo;what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count both kids</p>
<p>Put them in different breaktime locations</p>
<p>tantrums</p>
<p>never talk or argue with a tantruming child</p>

<h1 id="strengthening-your-relationship-with-your-children">Strengthening your relationship with your children</h1>
<ul>
<li>Make sure screen time does not replace face-to-face time</li>
<li>You value enjoying each other&rsquo;s company</li>
<li>critical for family well-being and child&rsquo;s self-esteem that you like them and not just love them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Strategies for Strengthening Your Relationships:</p>
<p>Practice sympathetic listening</p>
<p>Avoid over-parenting</p>
<p>Join in one-on-one fun</p>
<p>Solve problems together</p>
<p>if encouraging positive behavior in kids requires more motivation from the kids, it’s also going to require more motivation from Mom and Dad.</p>
<p>One minute per year of the child&rsquo;s life</p>
<p>Do not make eye contact or talk to child</p>
<p>Remain gentle but firm and instructive</p>
<p>You do not have to close the door</p>
<p>No lectures, explanations, or emotions after a break time</p>
<p>Explanations are appropriate when the behavior is new, unusual, or dangerous</p>
<p>Very gentle procedure to calm everyone down</p>
<p>If child behaves, praise him and enjoy his company, if they do something else that is countable, count it.</p>
<p>Parent should not be furious, yelling, lecturing, or physical or emotionally abusive</p>
<p>Most failures are because the parent forgets the no talking and no emotion rules</p>
<p>Timer doesn&rsquo;t start until child is done with tantrum (unless they are 3 or younger, then just let them out when their time is up, start the count over if they continue to misbehave after they get out)</p>
<p>Child can go to room and read, take a nap, play legos, draw, etc. No phone, no friends, and no electronic entertainment.</p>
<p>Use same strategy if company is over</p>
<p>Send kid and friend outside if they both get counted to 3</p>
<p>Give child a hug after break time if they want one.</p>
<p>Should happen right when the offense happens. Do not give a break time an hour later for something. If you can&rsquo;t give a breaktime right away then use a breaktime alternative.</p>
<p>What if kids wont go to break time?</p>
<p>Bring them to the room</p>
<p>Choose a breaktime Alternative (you can give them a choice between a couple consequences, you pick if they wont)</p>
<p>Reverse break time, you leave the room, walk around the house, don’t talk</p>
<p>If they won&rsquo;t come out of breaktime, that is okay, just tell them when their time is up</p>
<p>What if they leave their room?</p>
<p>Add extra time</p>
<p>Switch to break time alternative</p>
<p>Doorknob cover</p>
<p>Locking the door</p>
<p>Tell them if they come out then the door gets closed</p>
<p>Break Time Alternatives</p>
<p>Loss of privilege or toy for a period of time, bedtime fifteen minutes earlier, forty cents off the allowance, no electronic entertainment for two hours, and so on.)</p>
<p>Earlier bedtime</p>
<p>No dessert or treat</p>
<p>No use of phone</p>
<p>No friend over</p>
<p>No conversation—fifteen minutes</p>
<p>Removal of DVD, iPod</p>
<p>Reduced computer time</p>
<p>Loss of TV for evening</p>
<p>Loss of electronic games—two hours</p>
<p>Monetary fine</p>
<p>Small chore—wash bathroom sink</p>
<p>Larger chore—weed yard</p>
<p>Write a paragraph</p>
<p>(Limited only by your imagination)</p>
<p>Make them fair and reasonable</p>
<p>Make the punishment fit the behavior</p>
<p>Child has a fit when dropping off at daycare.</p>
<p>Model behavior yourself</p>
<p>Make activity fun or add diversions or friendly challenges</p>
<p>Seven start behavior tactics</p>
<p>You can use one or use a combination of many.</p>
<p>Positive reinforcement</p>
<p>Cheering and applauding, praise</p>
<p>Elaborate for younger kids, heartfelt for older kids</p>
<p>Praise in front of other people</p>
<p>Unexpected praise</p>
<p>Three positive comments for every negative comment</p>
<p>Simple requests</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to start your homework&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phrasing requests in a &ldquo;matter of fact&rdquo; tone</p>
<p>Try not to spring requests out of the blue, give them some warning</p>
<p>structure tasks into fixed routines</p>
<p>Kitchen timers</p>
<p>The docking system</p>
<p>if you don’t work, you don’t get paid</p>
<p>Charge them money for doing their chores</p>
<p>Natural consequences</p>
<p>let the big bad world teach lessons for you</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll do better next time!&rdquo; (offer encouragement)</p>

<p>This was a very insightful book. Knowing the balance between pain and pleasure is essential to living in modern day society. Where scarcity is no longer an issue. Our brains are not adapted for a world of abundance. So the forces that kept us alive for thousands of years, are now making us miserable. Consider this a primer into understanding addiction and over consumption. And steps you can take to mitigate this.</p>
<hr>
<p>Being sick and tired is a result of a skewed pain/pleasure balance. In order to find balance, you must understand the relationship between pleasure and pain in the body. Pleasure and pain operate in the same area of the brain and are intertwined.</p>
<p>Compulsive consumption leads to pain. And we all can face consumption issues. Even if we have good lives.</p>
<p>There are many factors that increase risk for over consumption and addiction. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biology</li>
<li>Mental illness</li>
<li>Trauma</li>
<li>Genetics</li>
<li>Poverty</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Limbic capitalism&rdquo; is the market force that profits on consumption. This provides access hyper novel and more potent substances and behaviors. More than any time in history.</p>
<p>Even the internet suggests behaviors that we would have not thought of doing in the first place. Porn and TikTok come to mind. We see crazy behaviors as &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; because other people on the internet are doing them.</p>
<p>The rush is never as good as you imagine.</p>
<p>Kids these days are growing up in padded environments and not ready for the real world. We have made them afraid of adversity and are encouraging hedonism and escapism.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t even put up with minor discomforts like being bored. We are always seeking out novelty and entertainment.</p>
<p>Go 30 minutes a day with nothing but your thoughts. This will help you become familiar with yourself, others, and the world. You are no longer running from painful thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>Boredom can be terrifying. It makes you think about big issues, meaning, and purpose. Boredom is an opportunity. You may discover something new. It gives your mind space to think.</p>
<p>You may attribute fatigue and the inability to focus to mental illness. But it could also be from sleep deprivation, over consumption,  and over stimulation.</p>
<p>The reason we are so miserable is because we are trying so hard not to be miserable.</p>
<h3 id="why-too-much-pleasure-leads-to-pain">Why too much pleasure leads to pain.</h3>
<p>Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in reward processing. It plays a bigger role in the motivation to get a reward than the pleasure of having the reward.</p>
<p>The brains reward pathway includes these parts of the brain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ventral tegmental</li>
<li>Nucleus accumbens</li>
<li>Prefrontal cortex</li>
</ul>
<p>The more/faster dopamine released from a drug or behavior, the more addictive the drug or behavior is.</p>
<p>Pleasure and pain function as a balance in the brain. When one side of the balance is weighted down, the brain compensates by pushing down on the opposite side. Pleasure leads to pain, pain leads to pleasure.</p>
<p>The brain wants to maintain homeostasis.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent-process_theory" rel="external" target="_blank">Opponent process theory</a> states that any prolonged or repeated departures from hedonic or effective neutrality have a cost.</p>
<p>With prolonged exposure to pleasure, our capacity to tolerate pain decreases, and our threshold for experiencing pleasure increases.</p>
<h4 id="the-negative-feedback-caused-by-tolerance">The negative feedback caused by tolerance</h4>
<p>Repeated exposure to a pleasure stimulus makes the pleasure from that stimulus less and less. And the rebound to the pain side gets stronger and longer. You need more of a behavior or substance over time to feel the same amount of pleasure.</p>
<p>Over time, your baseline gets set to the side of pain, as your brain tries to counteract bigger and more potent doses of pleasure. See how this bird starts out normal and healthy, then eventually needs it&rsquo;s drug just to feel normal: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUngLgGRJpo" rel="external" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUngLgGRJpo</a></p>
<p>People who do Opioids for a long time often experience more pain not less. This is referred to as &ldquo;opioid induced hyperglasia&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Heavy and prolonged dopamine leads to a baseline that is dopamine deficient. Hedonism leads to ahedonia.</p>
<p>Universal symtoms of withdrawl include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Irritability</li>
<li>Insomnia</li>
<li>Dysphoria</li>
</ul>
<p>The pain from withdrawl is what drives people to relapse, withdrawl is the pleasure/pain balance tipping towards the side of pain.</p>
<p>If you wait long enough, you can reset your dopamine baseline. (in most cases) And you can regain pleasure in simple things like going for walks, listening to birds, reading, writing, watching the sun rise, etc.</p>
<h4 id="dopamine-cues">Dopamine cues</h4>
<p>Cue dependant learning or pavlovian conditioning is when dopamine is released in the brain in response to a conditioned cue. This leads to pleasure in anticipation of a reward. When the cue happens, dopamine drops below baseline, which leads us to seek out the reward.</p>
<p>Dopamine levels below baseline drive craving. The cycle of craving can occur outside of conscious awareness. Dopamine levels raise once we get the reward, but falls below baseline if the reward doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Loss chasing: when the uncertainty of getting a reward is as reinforcing as the reward it self. Like gambling or likes on social media.</p>
<p>These conditioned reward pathways can cause permanent brain changes. But new pathways can always be forged with dopamine-healthy activities like human connection or exercise.</p>
<p>Even learning releases dopamine.</p>
<h4 id="balance-is-person-independent">Balance is person independent.</h4>
<p>Pleasure and pain can happen at the same time like with spicy food. Something that one person finds pleasurable or painful may not be the same for someone else. And not everyone starts with a level balance.</p>
<p>People injured in war are sometimes in less pain because they are pulled into a safer environment when they are being treated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are Cacti in a rainforest&rdquo; -Dr. Tom Finucane. Our brains have evolved for a world of scarcity, but we live in a new world of abundance.</p>
<h2 id="dopamine-fasting">Dopamine Fasting</h2>
<p>We must abstain from the unwanted behavior in order to truly have clarity on how it effects us. High dopamine subtances or behaviors cloud or ability to see cause and effect. And young people are more immune to immediate negative impacts than adults.</p>
<p>Here are 8 steps to a dopamine fast:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get information on the details of your dopamine use. What, when, how often?</li>
<li>Find out your personal reason for doing the dopamine inducing behavior. Even seemingly irrational behavior is often rooted in personal logic.</li>
<li>What problems is the drug or behavior causing? Short term? Long term?</li>
<li>Go for a set period without the drug or behavior.</li>
<li>Use mindfulness to observe your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations as separate from yourself.</li>
<li>Abstaining gives new insight to the behaviors.</li>
<li>Decide if you will continue using in a controlled way. Or go completely without.</li>
<li>Experiment to find out what works and what doesn&rsquo;t.</li>
</ol>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick and tired of being sick and tired&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you want to be doing this 10 years from now? How about 5? 1? 6 months from now? You may as well try to stop now. Consider your current behaviors for your future self.</p>
<p>You must go without the drug or behavior in order to reset your dopamine baseline and to truly see the cause and effect between substance use and how you feel.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t replace one drug with another because you will still be weighing down the pleasure side of the balance. And something less potent won&rsquo;t feel like a reward because your baseline for pleasure is too high.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t feel better after a dopamine fast then you may have some other underlying medical problem. But you will feel worse before you feel better. Withdrawl can last anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months or longer.</p>
<p>Use mindfulness to observe without judging yourself. Have compassion for yourself. The thoughts and emotions you have been running from will come crashing down on you during withdrawl. Instead of running, tolerate it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that moderation can backfire.</p>
<h4 id="limit-access-through-self-binding">Limit access through self-binding.</h4>
<p>Self-binding is placing barriers between you and the reward to help get over the limitations of willpower. Willpower gets tired the more we use it. This is a tool, not a fail safe.</p>
<p>You do self binding while your will is strong. Not when the cue, routine, reward cycle has already started and your willpower goes down.</p>
<p>Make it harder to access the reward.</p>
<p>This can be through physical barriers or distance. Such as a ksafe or weight loss surgeries. It can also be based on time limits and finish lines. Such as setting a time of day to use or a reward for accomplishing something.</p>

<p>
 "Forgive yourself, you have problems like everyone else." </div>
</div>
<p>Track your usage to become more aware. Overall awareness will help mitigate consumption.</p>
<p>Delay discounting is when high dopamine messes with our ability to delay gratification. &ldquo;Temporal horizons&rdquo; shrink when we are under the spell of a drug. You become governed by the pleasure-pain balance, instead of by reason. You can no longer objectively evaluate immediate rewards vs their long term counterparts.</p>

</div>
<p>The opposite is also true, immediate rewards activate emotion and reward parts of the brain. When you delay rewards, you activate the prefrontal cortex. Which is involved in planning and abstract thinking.</p>
<p>Categorical self binding is avoiding anything that could entertain your addict mind. Like how scrolling instagram can lead to seeking out porn. Sort dopamine into categories. Ones that you will allow yourself to consume, and ones you do not. This helps avoid triggers that lead to craving.</p>
<p>This is useful for substances that we can&rsquo;t eliminate all together but want to have a healthier relationship with like food, sex, smartphones, etc.</p>
<p>This can fail if you accidentally include a triggering behavior in your list of acceptable behaviors.</p>
<p>You can also transform an object into a symbol of restraint. Such as putting a single beer on display to remind you of what you are doing.</p>
<p>Rather than feeling restrained by this new way of living, you will feel liberated.</p>
<p>Intimacy from drugs doesn&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>There are drugs may help with addictions, but have the potential to become addictive themselves. Perscription stimulants like adderal are the molecular equivalent to meth. They cause huge spikes of dopamine and have high high potential for abuse.</p>
<p>These drugs could also potentially make things worse in the long run and have unintended consequences.</p>
<p>ADHD drug treatment is associated with deterioration in academic and social-emotional functioning.</p>
<p>Antidepressants may lead to tolerance and dependence and make depression worse in the long run (tardive dysphoria).</p>
<p>Instead of feeling better than well, these drugs may make us feel other than well. And can limit our ability to experience the full range of emotions needed for a balanced life.</p>
<p>We may be making large portions of the population indifferent to intolerable circumstances. Corporations and governments have the potential to use drugs as a form of social control.</p>
<p>There are as many as 10,000 toddlers receiving stimulants like ritalin.</p>
<p>When you are numb to everything, you lose your hunger for anything. Medications can be lifesaving, but there are other tools than can help.</p>
<h3 id="why-you-should-lean-on-pain">Why you should lean on pain</h3>
<p>We feel great after a cold shower. The first seconds are painful, tell yourself this is temporary.</p>

<p>Dopamine and norepinephrine levels rise 250 and 530% above baseline respectively. And remain elevated hours after. And have been shown to raise serotonin and neuronal growth.</p>
<p>Pressing on the pain side of the balance can lead to pleasure. The dopamine that results is indirect and potentially longer lasting. Just like how the body restores balance by leaning toward pain after a pleasure stimuli, the body will restore balance towards pleasure from a painful stimuli.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;With intermittent exposure to pain, our natural hedonic set point gets weighted to the side of pleasure, such that we become less vulnerable to pain and more able to feel pleasure over time.&rdquo; -pg 145 Dopamine Nation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Socrates on the relationship between pain and pleasure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;How strange would appear to be this thing that men call pleasure! And how curiously it is related to what is thought to be its opposite, pain! The two will never be found together in a man, and yet if you seek the one and obtain it, you are almost bound always to get the other as well, just as though they were both attached to one and the same head. . . . Wherever the one is found, the other follows up behind. So, in my case, since I had pain in my leg as a result of the fetters, pleasure seems to have come to follow it up.&rdquo; -pg 147 Dopamine Nation</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="hormesis">Hormesis</h3>
<p>Using pain to treat pain has been around forever.</p>
<p>Hormesis is the study of using small doses of &ldquo;pain&rdquo; to trigger the body&rsquo;s adaptive processes. (Cold, heat, gravitational changes, radiation, food restriction, exercise, etc.) These adaptive processes improve tolerance and functionality of the system to harder challenges.</p>
<p>Intermittent fasting in animals increased life span, reduced blood pressure, and improved Heart Rate Variability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Exercise is immediately toxic to cells, leading to increased temperatures, noxious oxidants, and oxygen and glucose deprivation. Yet the evidence is overwhelming that exercise is health-promoting, and the absence of exercise, especially combined with chronic sedentary feeding—eating too much all day long—is deadly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Exercise increases many of the neurotransmitters involved in positive mood regulation: dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, endocannabinoids, and endogenous opioid peptides (endorphins). Exercise contributes to the birth of new neurons and supporting glial cells. Exercise even reduces the likelihood of using and getting addicted to drugs.&quot; -pg 150 Dopamine Nation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dopamine and movement are deeply connected. Do obtain what we desire, we need to go get it. Do drugs just remind us that we have bodies?</p>
<p>Exercise is more beneficial to positive mood, sleep, cognition than any pill. Even a 30 minute walk is beneficial. Just remember that pleasure comes AFTER pain.</p>
<p>The extreme side of pain can cause it&rsquo;s own addiction. So be careful. Too much pain can deplete dopamine, causing overconsumption. So just slightly lean into pain. Build progress over time.</p>
<h3 id="truth-telling">Truth telling</h3>
<p>Telling the truth is another &ldquo;pain leads to pleasure&rdquo;. You can trick yourself when you are lying. So you are inhibiting self-awareness as well when you tell the truth. Writing in a journal is a good way to master yourself with truth telling.</p>
<p>Denial is caused by the disconnect between our reward pathway and higher brain regions. (Prefrontal cortex)</p>
<p>Prefrontal coretex is involved in planning, storytelling, decision making, emotional regulation, etc.</p>
<p>Telling the truth activates the prefrontal cortex and strengthens it through repeated use.</p>
<h3 id="awareness">Awareness</h3>
<p>What behavior or habit do you want to change? Why? And what would you be giving up if you stopped that behavior? What is one step you can take to change the behavior?</p>
<h3 id="honesty-makes-connections-with-other-humans">Honesty makes connections with other humans</h3>
<p>We assume people will abandon us when we expose our vulnerabilities. But they really assure other people of their own doubts, fears, and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Human connection increases Oxytocin. Oxytocin binds to dopamine-secreting neurons and enhances the reward circuit tract. Human connection replaces addiction.</p>
<p>Consuming leads to isolation. Because you replace the reward you get from Human connections with artificial rewards.</p>
<p>Human connection can be exploited as an addiction as well. When it is used for selfish gratifications rather than through shared humanity. Like when people are Grandstanding and manipulating.</p>
<p>Do not share stories about your addictions to show off. Only share them to teach lessons. Tell accurate stories about yourself. Do not play the victim. Take responsibility. Accurate stories help you make accurate decisions.</p>
<p>Write down your character defects and ways those hurt your relationships.</p>
<p>Social media has led us to creating false self&rsquo;s about what our lives are really like. If we don&rsquo;t feel real, we isolate and become depersonalized.</p>
<p>Honesty tethers ourselves to reality and makes us feel real in the world.</p>
<p>Getting control of your addictions can lead others to do the same.</p>
<p>Keep your promises to children. The children benefit and are better able to regulate their emotions.</p>
<p>People will feel more confident around you because they can trust you.</p>
<h3 id="prosocial-shame">Prosocial Shame</h3>
<p>Destructive shame is when the group condemns or shuns when someone makes a mistake. Over consumption leads to shame, which leads to lying, which leads to isolation, which continues the circle to over consumption.</p>
<p>Prosocial shame is when the group holds us closer and provides steps to redemption. It says that shame is useful for thriving communities. We all have our flaws and need forgiveness. Instead of leading to lying, it leads to truth telling and acceptance and breaks the cycle of addiction.</p>
<p>If we are open and honest to our children about our mistakes and struggles, children will be more open and honest with us about theirs. Admit when we have been wrong.</p>
<p>We feel deeply connected to others when we feel accepted despite our flaws.</p>
<p>Social media makes us compare ourselves to the entire world. Leading us to believe we should have done more.</p>
<p>Immerse ourselves in the world instead of turning away from it.</p>
<p>Finding balance does not happen instantly. It requires patience, courage, and maintenance. You must have faith that the small actions you take every day will pay off in the future.</p>

<p>Date Read: 2024-04-22. How Strongly I Recommend It: 8/10</p>
<p>This second half of the book was almost an identical copy of the second half of the book. But still filled with solid advice on establishing a vision, settings goals, measuring the effectiveness of your actions, and other tidbits about being effective and taking action.</p>
<p>I have been implementing most of this and needed to go back through to make sure I&rsquo;ve got down the process.</p>
<p>I highly advise you make your own outline so you do not have to read everything &ldquo;twice again&rdquo;.</p>
<hr>
<p>The barrier between the life you are living and the life you want is effective execution. Getting in shape is not a knowledge problem, it&rsquo;s an execution problem. In order to maintain effective execution, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on the things that matter</li>
<li>Maintain a sense of urgency</li>
<li>Get rid of low value activity</li>
</ul>
<p>Annual goals remove the sense of urgency we need to achieve our goals. 12 weeks is long enough to get things done, but short enough to not let you lose sight of your goals. Every 12 weeks you get a fresh start.</p>
<p>If you have had a bad 12 week year you can shake it off and start fresh. If you have had a good 12 week year, then you can build off the momentum.</p>
<p>At the end of each 12 week year, take a week of to reflect, regroup, and re-energize. You have 4 times as many opportunities to set new goals and celebrate your accomplishments.</p>
<p>Each weeks counts. And each day counts as you increase your focus on a few important daily tasks. Focusing on the short term keeps you from getting ahead of yourself.</p>
<h3 id="you-need-a-strong-emotional-stake-in-your-goals">You need a strong emotional stake in your goals</h3>
<p>Action is uncomfortable, you must have values in place. You must value your higher purpose more than your comfort. If you establish a compelling vision of the future. And align your short term goals and plans with that vision. Then it will be easier to cope with short term discomforts.</p>
<h4 id="questions-to-ask-when-creating-your-vision">Questions to ask when creating your vision:</h4>
<ul>
<li>What do you truly want to achieve?</li>
<li>What legacy do you want to create?</li>
<li>What do you want for yourself and your family?</li>
<li>What do you want spiritually?</li>
<li>What level of security do you seek?</li>
<li>What level of income and fulfillment do you want from your career?</li>
<li>What interests do you wish you could pursue?</li>
<li>What do you really want to do with the time you have been allotted?</li>
</ul>
<p>You create things mentally before you create them physically. And you will never outpace your mental models. Vision is where you engage your thinking about what is possible for you.</p>
<p>People focus on only their career or business. But those are only certain aspects of life. You need to establish a vision of your whole life, and align your business goals around that.</p>
<p>You need to make your vision compelling enough to act on it. This is what creates the emotional connection needed to act on your goals.</p>
<p>This creates passion.</p>
<h4 id="the-execution-system">The execution system</h4>
<p>The eight fundamental elements can be broken down into 5 disciplines and 3 principles.</p>
<p>5 Disciplines</p>
<ol>
<li>Vision</li>
<li>Planning</li>
<li>Process Control</li>
<li>Measurement</li>
<li>Time use</li>
</ol>
<p>3 Principles</p>
<ol>
<li>Accountability</li>
<li>Commitment</li>
<li>Greatness in the moment</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-create-a-personal-vision">How to create a personal vision</h2>
<p>Find out what you want in all areas of life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spiritual</li>
<li>Relationships</li>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Income</li>
<li>Lifestyle</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Community</li>
</ul>
<p>Your career or business vision is is more powerful when it is developed in light of your personal vision. Once you have a personal vision, you can figure exactly the amount of income or production you need from your career or business.</p>
<p>By thinking about your vision often, your strengthen the areas of the brain that would help you make that happen.</p>
<p>Shift from a &ldquo;How?&rdquo; mindset to a &ldquo;What if?&rdquo; mindset. This helps you see your vision as possible. Then to &ldquo;How might I?&rdquo; and determine a plan. This helps you see your vision as probable.</p>
<p>Next, Implement your plan. This moves your vision from probable to Given.</p>
<h4 id="three-time-horizons-for-your-vision">Three time horizons for your vision</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long term aspirations</li>
<li>Mid-term (3 years)</li>
<li>12 weeks</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="long-term-aspirations">Long term aspirations</h5>
<p>Imagine and embrace all possibilities. What do you want to have, do, and be in your life? What is most important to you in each life category? How much free time? What level of income?</p>
<p>What is your vision 5, 10, and 15 years into the future?</p>
<h5 id="mid-term-3-years">Mid-term (3 years)</h5>
<p>What do you want to create over the next 3 years based on your long term vision?</p>
<h4 id="ask-yourself-these-questions">Ask yourself these questions</h4>
<p>Why are these things important to you?
What does your vision unlock for you?
What will be different for you, and those around you, if you reach that goal?
Who will you share your vision with?
How often have you looked at your vision?
What risks or barriers might get in the way?</p>
<h3 id="team-or-family-vision">Team or family vision</h3>
<p>Have each member work through their personal visions. Then come together and make a group vision that aligns with everyone&rsquo;s personal visions.</p>
<h3 id="do-this">Do this</h3>
<ul>
<li>Take your vision seriously. Keep it in front of you and align your plans with it. Review it often.</li>
<li>Think BIG. Your vision should challenge you.</li>
<li>Share your vision with others, print it out, review it daily. Find ways to make it more meaningful and vivid.</li>
<li>Reflect on each day. Was it filled with activity that moved you toward your vision? What action will you take tomorrow?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-12-week-year">The 12 week year</h2>
<p>A vision without a plan is just a dream. Working from a plan helps you focus on the right things, saves you time, and reduces mistakes. You make your mistakes when writing your plan down on paper. A plan helps you cut through unimportant distractions that pop up every day.</p>
<p>Quarterly goals are typically smaller goals that help you get to your annual goals. 12 week years are shrinking your annual goals into 12 weeks. Each 12 weeks stands alone.</p>
<p>12 weeks is a more predictable time frame. The farther the goal, the more unpredictable. Which makes it harder and harder to plan for. it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to predict what your actions should be 12 months into the future.</p>
<p>12 weeks narrows your focus and keeps you from spreading yourself too thin. 12 weeks also gives you structure.</p>
<h3 id="1-set-goals">1. Set goals</h3>
<p>Identify your 1-3 goals for the 12 weeks. This goals are the next 1-3 steps toward your long term vision. Then, create the tactics, or the daily or weekly actions you need to take to reach those goals.</p>
<p>Consistent action on few critical tasks is what drives success. Like dropping water wearing away on a stone.</p>
<p>Spend 20 minutes at the beginning of each week to review your previous week and plan the new one. Spend the first 5 minutes of each day reviewing your weekly plan and setting your plan for the day accordingly.</p>
<p>Check in with this plan multiple times per day and make sure you are executing on it.  A good goal is specific and measurable, positively stated, realistic, and time bound.</p>
<p>Ask yourself why this goal is important to you? What will be different if your achieve this goal?</p>
<p>Is this in line with your vision?</p>
<h3 id="2-create-a-plan">2. Create a plan</h3>
<p>Set the actions needed, and when they are to be acted on, as daily or weekly tasks. Brainstorm on a sheet of paper all of the things you need to do to or ideas to achieve your goal.</p>
<p>What actions will you struggle with? What can you do to overcome those struggles? Select the smallest number of the brainstormed actions needed to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>Trying to execute too many tactics will spread you thin.</p>
<p>Keep it simple.</p>
<h3 id="3-set-up-process-controls">3. Set up Process controls</h3>
<p>Process controls are what you do to keep your plan from breaking down in a lapse of willpower. The two elements of process control are a weekly plan, and peer support.</p>
<p>A weekly plan gives you clarity. Not all is lost when you lose 50% of a week.</p>
<p>Peer support creates room for getting help from others. Meet on a weekly basis to discuss progress, struggles, and challenges. Encourage one another. Form a group of 2-4 committed people.</p>
<p>Weekly meeting agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual report
<ol>
<li>Results to date</li>
<li>Weekly execution score</li>
<li>Intentions for the coming week</li>
<li>Feedback and suggestions from the group</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Discuss what has been working and how to incorporate that into each other&rsquo;s plan</li>
<li>Encouragement</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="weekly-plan">Weekly plan</h4>
<p>Take 15 minutes at the beginning of each week to plan the week on paper. Make sure you include all of your tasks for the week. Do not assume each week will be the same. And do not (usually) add extra tactics that weren&rsquo;t in the original plan. Use this plan to guide your day.</p>
<p>Only change your plan if you have been executing and it&rsquo;s not working.</p>
<h4 id="weekly-score">Weekly Score</h4>
<p>Measuring your success will tell you if what you are doing it working. And lets you know what adjustments to make. The data you get from measuring does not care about efforts or intentions. Only on outcomes. Are you getting the outcome you desire?</p>
<p>The sooner you confront yout outcomes, the sooner you can figure out what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. Then you can shift your focus to what is working.</p>
<p>Measure lead and lag indicators.</p>
<p>Lag indicators measure overall results such as lbs lost, money made, etc. Lead indicators measure the activities that produce the results. Are you following through with your plan?</p>
<p>You can always control results, but you can control execution in real time. So Lead indicators should be your primary focus.</p>
<p>If you are not hitting your goals, is it a problem with the plan? Or with the execution of that plan? Is your strategy flawed? Or are you failing to implement that strategy? Once you identify your problem, you can address it head on.</p>
<p>Establish a set of lead and lag indicators for each of your goals. And measure your lead indicators as a percentage of tactics completed. (measuring execution, not results.) Score yourself on the percentage of tactics completed that week.</p>
<p>Strive for excellence, not perfection. Aim for 85% and you will most likely achieve your objectives. Even 65-70% is better than nothing.</p>
<p>Facing the reality of your actions is hard. You will be uncomfortable if you are not doing the things you need to do. (Productive tension)</p>
<p>Use this as a catalyst for change, instead of running away.</p>
<h4 id="teamfamily-process-control">Team/Family Process Control</h4>
<p>Does everyone have a plan for each week?
Are they scoring each week?
Are they participating in a weekly group meeting?</p>
<h3 id="4-use-your-time-with-purpose">4. Use your time with purpose</h3>
<p>Say no to things that go against your goals. Organize your life around your priorities that make progress toward your vision. Be intentional about how you allocate your time.</p>
<p>T.V. may be beneficial in some ways, but helping us live a life of significance is not one of them.</p>
<p>You may be doing busy work that is actually unimportant to the goals at hand.</p>
<p>Align your time and energy with what you do best and what you enjoy doing.</p>
<h3 id="5-performance-time">5. Performance time</h3>
<p>Blocking out time chunks to work on important tasks. There are three categories of performance time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Strategic blocks</li>
<li>Buffer blocks</li>
<li>Breakout blocks</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="strategic-blocks">Strategic blocks</h4>
<p>3 hour block of time scheduled early into each week. Block out every distractions and work on core tasks. Reschedule if this gets interrupted. Time to work on your business not in it. Focus on one thing at a time. NO  DISTRACTIONS!</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect with your vision</li>
<li>12 week review</li>
<li>Assess performance breakdowns</li>
<li>Work on tactics</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="buffer-blocks">Buffer blocks</h4>
<p>For unplanned and low value activities lie checking email, phone calls, organizing, etc. 1-2 30 minute buffer blocks per day.</p>
<h4 id="breakout-blocks">Breakout blocks</h4>
<p>Taking time away from work. 3 hours long and spent on things other than your business. Used to refresh and reinvigorate your mind. Helps prevent burnout and create free time.</p>
<h3 id="6-creating-a-routine">6. Creating a routine</h3>
<p>Create an ideal week calendar where your schedule your performance time and organize critical tasks so that you will be most productive.  Consider when you tend to be at your best. And schedule important tasks around those times.</p>
<h3 id="7-taking-ownership">7. Taking ownership</h3>
<p>Own your results regardless of circumstances. Tap into your resources and give it your best. Own the things you can control (Your thinking and actions). Be willing to confront the truth about your situation.</p>
<p>Learn from failures and do not place blame.</p>
<p>Remove the victim mindset. Stop feeling sorry for yourself.</p>
<p>Be willing to take new and improved actions. And surround yourself with people who also take ownership.</p>
<p>Clarify expectations. Learn from life and focus on the future. Acknowledge reality.</p>
<p>Focus on the things that you can control.</p>
<h3 id="8-12-week-commitments">8. 12 week commitments</h3>
<p>Commitments are not broken when things get hard. Commitment fosters trust, confidence, and improves results. You are bound emotionally to a course of action.</p>
<p>When you are interested in something it can be abandoned. When you are committed, you are bound to results. You make no excuses.</p>
<h4 id="keys-to-successful-commitments">Keys to successful commitments</h4>
<ul>
<li>You have a strong desire that is meaningful.</li>
<li>You identify the one or two core actions that will give you the result.</li>
<li>You identify the costs associated with keeping the commitment.</li>
<li>You act on the commitments rather than on your feelings.</li>
</ul>
<p>12 week commitments are easier that 12 months ones. With a true commitment, don&rsquo;t give yourself an out. Even if you fail. You gave it your all.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t give up if you break a commitment once. And confront missed commitments.</p>
<p>Value your word.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t over commit by taking on more than you can handle. Go public with your commitments and find a buddy.</p>
<h4 id="greatness-happens-in-the-moment">Greatness happens in the moment</h4>
<p>Your daily actions decide your greatness long before the results ever show up. The daily difference between mediocrity and greatness is slim. But the difference down the road is tremendous.</p>
<h3 id="intentional-imbalance">Intentional imbalance</h3>
<p>Like balance is where you are purposeful about where your spend your time and efforts. It is not about spending equal time in all areas of life. You identify the most important areas of your life to work on, and set your 12 week goals to make progress in those areas.</p>
<p>Then, re evaluate the areas of yourlife that need work for the next 12 weeks. Rate the areas of your life out of 10. (Spiritual, Relationships, Family, Income, Lifestyle, Health, Community)</p>
<p>Then Work on the lowest ones.</p>
<h3 id="the-emotional-cycle-of-change">The emotional cycle of change</h3>
<p>5 stages people move through emotionally when changing their behavior</p>

<li>Informed Pessimism
You begin to experience the costs and wonder if they are worth the end goal.</li>
<li>Valley of despair
When most people give up. All of the pain of change is felt and the benefits seem far away or unimportant.</li>
<li>Informed Optimism
New actions are becoming routine and you start to feel the benefits.</li>
<li>Success and fulfillment
Cost of change are gone, benefits are fully realized</li>
</ol>
<p>Every time you complete this cycle, your capacity and confidence increase. Awareness of this cycle is important to help you manage negative emotions.</p>

<p>This only works if they immediately respond to the replacement command</p>
<p>If you have to repeat the cue several times with Rambo jumping up on you then you are rewarding them with attention for jumping and teaching them to ignore your commands</p>
<h2 id="lets-walk">Let&rsquo;s Walk</h2>
<p>When you tolerate pulling, your dog learns that pulling gets them where they want to go</p>
<p>If you want to get fancy, you can teach your dog different cues for walking in different positions</p>
<p>For now, think of walks as training games rather than to get to a destination or exercise.</p>
<p>Keep sessions short at first</p>
<p>Drive them to off leash play areas or other destinations until they get good at walking</p>
<p>Practice after they have burned off some excess energy</p>
<p>Hang out and walk around for a bit, everytime your dog is walking near you, click and treat</p>
<p>Use verbal &ldquo;let&rsquo;s walk&rdquo; cue once they get the hang of it.</p>

<p>Change directions for more loose leash opportunities</p>
<p>Do not jerk the leash</p>
<p>Do not let them get environmental rewards for pulling</p>
<p>Let them earn environmental rewards with Cue &ldquo;go sniff!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Use front-clip no-pull harness for dog that drags</p>
<p>If they pull back on treat shape them forward with clicks</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let them get rewarded for stopping</p>
<p>Use high value treat for outdoors save that treat for only outdoors</p>
<p>Remember to back up a few steps if you get derailed</p>
<p>Sit on a bench for an hour with treats to desensitize them to being outdoors</p>

<p>Use tether if dog is out of control</p>
<p>Only use leash as tether if dog won&rsquo;t chew on it.</p>
<p>Watch them while tethered so they don’t learn chew on tether</p>
<p>Put comfortable rug or bed and chew toys at teher spots</p>
<p>When they get out of control say &ldquo;too bad Luke, time out&rdquo; and a few minutes on tether</p>
<p>Can pre-tether if you know they are going to flip out in a certain situation to prevent it from happening</p>
<p>Ignore barking or whining</p>
<p>Only release when calm and quiet so they don&rsquo;t learn that fussing gets them released.</p>
<p>Must release them when they settle so they know that being calm earns freedom</p>
<p>You can do another timeout right after if they rev up again</p>
<p>Cheerful interlude not a forceful punishment</p>
<h1 id="week-3">Week 3</h1>
<h2 id="wait">Wait</h2>

<p>When he is easily taking the toy from your hand try throwing it on the floor when you say take it, click and treat when he picks it up</p>
<p>Gradually increase distance that you toss the toy (racing across the yard to take a toy)</p>
<p>Keep take sessions short. Stop before they get tired or bored</p>
<p>Vary the item you ask them to take</p>
<p>Start delaying the click for holds</p>

<h2 id="stay">Stay</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Stay in the position I left you until I tell you to get up&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three Elements to stay:</p>
<p>Duration – How long dog stays</p>
<p>Distraction - Realiability</p>
<p>Distance – Distance you can move away from dog</p>
<p>Work on duration and distraction first</p>
<p>Do not ask for too much too soon</p>
<p>Ask them to sit for one second, click and treat and be calm so they don&rsquo;t jump up</p>
<p>Use release word to encourage dog to get up</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t click the release cause you are training the stay behavior</p>
<p>Starts adding several seconds then the &ldquo;stay&rdquo; cue</p>
<p>Slowy increase seconds in stay</p>
<p>Click and reward during the stay several times</p>
<p>Keep reminding them with more &ldquo;stay&rdquo; cues</p>
<p>Release before dog decides to move on their own</p>
<p>Wisk treat behind back if dog gets up (negative punishment)</p>
<p>Process for &ldquo;down&rdquo; stay is the same.</p>
<p>Gradually fade the treat away from in front of them</p>
<p>After they stay for 10-20 seconds add distractions</p>
<p>Step to side click release, jump on one foot click release!</p>
<p>Taking it gradually is the key here.</p>
<p>Then add distance</p>
<p>Teach them that stay is never over until you return to them</p>
<p>At higher levels you can call from stay 1 out of 10 times</p>
<p>After distance is mastered start combining the 3 elements</p>
<p>Always return before they leave stay position</p>
<p>Return to easier version if they start making mistakes</p>
<h2 id="give">Give</h2>
<p>Great for getting stuuf out of puppy mouths</p>
<p>Start with toy in puppies mouth</p>
<p>Say give and hold out treat in hand, when she drops toy to ground click but hold treat until you pick up toy. Let her nibble on treat while you do this. Toss the toy again for life reward as well</p>
<p>Practice this with forbidden objects (accidently drop on near her so you don&rsquo;t encourage playing with it)</p>
<p>Try not to grab objects from the dog, instead play the give game</p>
<p>Do not do this for resource guarders</p>

<p>Then wait, do not repeat the leave it cue and don&rsquo;t pull him back. When they look away from the pile click and give a high value treat.</p>
<p>Then go to the next pile and repeat</p>

<h1 id="the-poisoned-cue">The poisoned Cue</h1>
<p>Habituation occurs when your dog learns to ignore an environmental stimulus—a sound,</p>
<p>Sometimes sensitization occurs instead. Rather than habituating to a sound such as the doorbell, a dog may become more and more reactive each time the stimulus occurs. Thunder sensitivity is a perfect example of this.</p>
<p>Learned irrelevance is similar to habituation. It applies to a dog who has learned to ignore a specific cue, rather than become accustomed to a startling stimulus. This is not deliberate willfulness on the dog’s part, but rather her lack of response to a cue that has failed to have consistent and sufficiently strong significance attached to it. The cue becomes meaningless if it doesn’t have a consequence.</p>
<p>“poisoned cue.” A cue becomes poisoned when it sometimes has a negative consequence instead of a positive one.</p>
<p>it will be easier for you to train her to come with a new cue than to try to make the association consistently positive.</p>
<p>I have heard owners and trainers use words such as close, let’s go, and here in place of a poisoned Come.</p>
<p>Once you’ve trained a new Come cue, you have to remember not to poison that one too. If you have to do something to your dog that she’s not fond of, do something wonderful when she gets to you, and a few minutes later end the fun and do the not-so-nice thing.</p>
<p>Or go get her instead of calling her to you. Meanwhile, make it a point to change her association with the things she doesn’t like. Teach her that a hand moving toward her collar makes yummy treats happen.</p>
<p>Teach her that a hand moving toward her paw makes yummy treats happen. Then touching her paw. Then holding her paw. Then touching her paw with nail clippers. This process of counterconditioning and desensitization—changing the association with a stimulus—can be applied in countless training and behavior modification situations.</p>
<p>It works best when done gradually with numerous repetitions at each step, and not moving on until the dog is obviously happy about the process at each step.</p>
<p>The fewer things a dog must do in her world (or have done to her) that she doesn’t like, the less likely you are to poison her Come cue!</p>
<h2 id="salience">SALIENCE</h2>
<p>When we say something is salient to a dog, we mean it has noticeable significance to her. Your dog learns to sit even in the face of distractions because the hotdog you are holding in front of her face is very salient.</p>
<p>significant. The salient stimuli in the environment—you, your hotdogs, and the Sit cue—are more significant than the distractions. They overshadow the dog barking across the street, the skateboarder whizzing by on the road, the slamming of a car door down the block. If your dog is too distracted to respond to the Sit cue, then the distractions are more salient than you and your hotdogs.</p>
<p>You either need to move your training to a less distracting environment, or find a way to make you, your treats, and your cues more significant to your dog.</p>
<h2 id="blocking">BLOCKING</h2>
<p>when the use of a known cue overrides the dog’s ability to learn a new cue for the same behavior. Keep in mind that while dogs can only learn one response to a particular cue (sit must always mean “sit,” it can’t sometimes mean lie down), they can learn several cues that all mean the same behavior.</p>
<p>(treat), I introduce the verbal cue and explain that any new cue being taught must always precede the known cue.</p>
<p>I use a demo dog to show them that the dog doesn’t initially understand or respond to the word down until we associate it with the luring motion that means “down” to the dog.</p>
<p>The motion is salient to the dog—the word is not. I explain to my students that in order for the dog to hear the word and learn that it also has significance, they must say the word first, then lure the dog down.</p>
<p>If they give the verbal cue at the same time or after they lure, the lure blocks the dog’s ability to learn the new cue. With enough repetitions of the sequence—verbal cue, followed by lure (and click! and treat when the dog performs the behavior)—the dog will learn that the verbal cue also has salience, and you will no longer need to lure her down—she will lie down when you give her the verbal cue.</p>
<h2 id="fading-the-lure">FADING THE LURE</h2>
<p>One of the biggest complaints you’ll hear about positive training is that you always have to have food in your hand to get your dog to do what you ask. This is true only if you don’t make the effort to fade your lures—that is, to get your dog to respond to your cues when there’s no treat in sight. If you don’t fade lures fairly early in your training program, you and your dog can both become dependent on the presence of food to get behaviors to happen. The good news is it’s easy to fade lures; you just have to remember to follow the steps to do it. Let’s take Down as our example:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Lure the behavior: Move your treat toward the floor, clicking your dog for following, giving a nibble of treat with each click!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the cue: When she lures down easily every time, say the Down cue each time just before you lure her down. Repeat a half-dozen times. Remember to click! and treat each time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pause before luring: Now say “Down!” and pause. Wait for several seconds, then lure her down. Click! Treat. By following the word with the lure, you are translating, telling her that the word down means exactly the same thing as moving the treat toward the floor. Repeat several times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a little body language: As you say “Down!” or immediately thereafter, bend forward just a tiny bit from the waist. Since you probably bend forward when you lure, this little body language hint might jump-start your dog’s brain into moving down. If not, wait a few seconds and then lure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch for clues: Sometimes your dog will make small movements that tell you she’s starting to make the connection between the cue and the behavior. When you give the Down cue, she may look at the floor or lower her shoulders a little bit and then look at you as if to say, “Is this right? Is this what you mean?” If you catch these clues with a click! and quickly lure her the rest of the way, you’ve answered her question and she’ll probably understand and respond to the cue more quickly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="extinction">EXTINCTION</h2>
<p> Extinction means taking a behavior that has been reinforced and making it go away by removing all reinforcement.</p>
<p>You can deliberately extinguish an unwelcome behavior by taking away any reinforcement your dog might be getting for it. We extinguish the behavior of jumping up by making sure no one pets, talks to, or looks at the dog when she jumps, and by stepping away so she doesn’t even have the pleasure of making contact with her paws.</p>
<p>You can also accidentally extinguish a desired behavior by forgetting to reinforce it or by not reinforcing it enough. Reinforcement isn’t always treats—it’s anything your dog likes: toys, play, eye contact, praise, pets, runs . . .</p>
<p>When you use extinction to make a behavior go away, be aware that there is often an extinction burst—the behavior gets worse before it gets better because the dog is trying really hard to get reinforcement for a behavior that paid off in the past.</p>
<p>You want to be sure not to reinforce the dog during an extinction burst, or you’ve just taught her that trying harder gets reinforced. Don’t give in (unless the dog is in danger of injuring herself); comfort yourself with the knowledge that the extinction burst usually means you’re close to success.</p>
<p>spontaneous recovery. Days, weeks, or even months after you extinguished a behavior, it suddenly rears its ugly head again,</p>
<p>of circumstances occurred to refire the same old neuron pathway. The good news is, assuming you make sure the behavior isn’t reinforced, it should go away again quickly, and much more easily than the first time.</p>
<h2 id="premack">Premack</h2>
<p>you can use a more rewarding behavior as the reinforcer for a less rewarding behavior, thereby improving the performance of the lesser behavior.</p>
<p>For example, if your dog would rather chase a bunny than come when you call her, you can use the Premack principle to teach her that she will get to chase a bunny—sometimes—if she comes to you first.</p>
<p>You start by using Premack indoors in a controlled environment to teach her how it works, and when she’s doing well there, move her outside. Leave your dog on a sit/stay and walk across the room. Your helper, with a plate of tasty treats, stands halfway between you and your dog, slightly off to one side. Your helper should also have a bowl to cover the treats when your dog tries to eat them. Now call your dog. If she stops to investigate the plate of treats, the helper covers the plate and doesn’t let her have a taste.</p>
<p> You keep calling your dog cheerfully and enthusiastically. When she finally comes to you, gently grasp her collar, say “Good girl!” then release her collar and say “Go get it!” Race with your dog back to the treats, now uncovered, and let her have a couple of bites.</p>
<p>Then cover the plate and try it again. Eventually—sometimes surprisingly quickly—she will realize that she gets the treats sooner if she comes to you first and she will fly past the uncovered plate as fast as she can. This principle is also sometimes called Grandma’s Law, expressed as “You have to eat your vegetables before you can eat your dessert.”</p>
<p>There are a couple of drawbacks to using Premack in real life: (1) If the vegetables are too unpalatable, dessert may also lose its appeal; and (2) you can’t control the bunnies.</p>
<h2 id="generalization">Generalization</h2>
<p>how do you help your dog learn to generalize operant behaviors? By doing exactly what your trainer probably told you to do—practice with her in as many different places as possible.</p>
<h2 id="chaining-and-backchaining">CHAINING AND BACKCHAINING</h2>
<p>The behaviors are linked together so that each behavior is the signal for the next behavior in the chain, and the opportunity to perform the next behavior becomes the reinforcer for the previous one.</p>
<p>Backchaining begins with the last behavior in the chain. Each step is added in reverse order, until the dog is performing the complete behavior. The theory is that when you teach the last thing first, your dog is always moving toward what she knows best, so she gains confidence as she learns the new links in the chain. The theory works.</p>
<h2 id="the-principle-of-parsimony">THE PRINCIPLE OF PARSIMONY</h2>
<p>unless there is evidence to the contrary, you must account for a phenomenon with the simplest explanation available.</p>

<p>housetraining, an ounce of prevention is worth many pounds of cure.</p>
<p>will start using the phrase Do It when he starts to eliminate. This will teach him to go to the bathroom on cue</p>
<h1 id="social-misfits">Social Misfits</h1>
<p>As they get older (8 to 16 weeks), they are given careful exposure to other stimuli—visits to the vet hospital and groomer; walks in town; rides on elevators and escalators; sounds of cars, motorcycles, and skateboards; people of different ages, sexes, and ethnic backgrounds; people who dress, talk, and move in strange ways; and people with umbrellas, crutches, wheelchairs, and facial hair. The more positive exposures a dog has to a wide variety of experiences during this period, the more confident and well adjusted she will be throughout her life, and the more easily she will accept new experiences, even without prior exposure.</p>
<p>the steps to take to foster courage in an unsocialized canine:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Teach your dog a reward marker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reward-mark his entire meal. If the dog is extremely unsocialized—fearful even of you—let this be the only way she gets to eat: by being in your company and, eventually when she’s brave enough, by eating out of your hand. She needs to learn that you are the source of all good things. Reward-marking won’t work well for a free-roaming feral dog—she will have access to other food sources and won’t have to tolerate your presence to find food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reward-mark her for calm behavior around others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a list of her fear triggers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use counterconditioning and desensitization. Desensitization is the process of gradually acclimating the dog to the things she is afraid of. Counterconditioning means replacing her involuntary undesirable reaction—fear—with a more desirable one that is incompatible with fear, such as the eager anticipation of a tasty treat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reward-mark while others feed treats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teach her to target.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Caution: Avoid Coddling!</p>
<h1 id="be-happy">Be Happy</h1>
<p>Healthy dogs chew. They also bark, dig, and run around. These behaviors are natural and necessary for them.</p>
<p>teach him to go to the bathroom at appropriate appropriate times, in appropriate places. You will be far more successful in dealing with the challenges of chewing, digging, and barking if you address these natural behaviors the same way.</p>
<h1 id="choose-your-chews">CHOOSE YOUR CHEWS</h1>
<p>Stuffed Kong toys, marrow bones, and other indestructible but inviting chew objects are better choices than items that resemble our valued human possessions. Discarded socks and old tennis shoes teach a pup to head for the closet floor and the laundry basket when the chewing urge is strong.</p>
<p>Carrots, apples, and other hard raw fruits and vegetables are also ideal puppy chews—</p>
<p>Goodie Ship stuffed with liver treats.</p>
<p>Chewing is also a good stress reliever, which is why dogs who are anxious about being left alone at home often become destructive.</p>
<p>puppies should gradually be conditioned to being left alone so they can overcome their very strong and natural instinct to always be in the company of their pack. Providing your dog with a desirable and appropriate chew object prior to your calm departure can often help prevent separation anxiety from becoming a problem.</p>
<h1 id="safety-first">Safety First</h1>
<p>Dogs have been known to choke on rawhide, which can get soft and slimy when chewed,</p>
<p>Rope toys can shred, and if swallowed, the pieces of string can become entangled in a dog’s intestines—a life-threatening situation. Plastic eyes, noses, and squeakers from plush toys also pose a hazard to your dog’s well-being.</p>
<p>the black rubber Kong toys are among the toughest</p>
<h1 id="oldies-but-goodies">Oldies but Goodies</h1>
<p>you can regularly give your dog chicken and turkey wings and necks. Note: These are fed raw, not cooked, as part of a complete diet plan.</p>
<p>The Whole Dog Journal is a good resource for information on feeding a natural, healthy diet, as are books by Dr. Ian Billinghurst.</p>
<p>Punishing Jaws after you take a forbidden object away from him does no good—he is likely to think that the last thing he did (giving up the object) is what he’s being punished for. Jaws can learn very quickly that chewing on an item of high value to humans is a good thing to do because it will initiate a rousing game of chase the puppy. If you punish him after you catch him, you won’t teach him not to play the game; you’ll just teach him to run faster next time! Don’t let him suck you into his game—use management and supervision to interrupt and redirect him before he is doing doughnuts around the dining room table with your $150 running shoe in his mouth.</p>
<h1 id="digging">Digging</h1>
<p>Dogs who are most likely to engage in inappropriate digging are those who are left to their own devices in the backyard for long periods.</p>
<p>my philosophy of dog-human relationships, they belong anyway. Dogs are companion animals, and they serve that function best when they share our homes (dens) with us. Dogs who are exiled to a pen or to the backyard are often excruciatingly bored and/or lonely, which gives rise to a long list of behavior problems, including barking, digging, escaping, hyperactivity, poor socialization, and aggression.</p>
<p>If you want, you can even encourage your dog to dig—in the right place. Just as you teach your dog when and where it’s okay to go to the bathroom, you can teach Dozer when and where it’s okay for him to dig. You can build a wooden digging box frame—spacious enough to accommodate Dozer’s size with room to spare—and set it where you want him to dig. Dig up the dirt within the framed area so it is soft and inviting. If your dirt is hard clay, add sand and potting soil to break up the soil and keep it soft. Now invite Dozer to dig in his box by burying a toy or bone just beneath the surface of the soil. Get excited and tell Dozer to go dig. Then help him dig up the toy. Repeat this game often, until he will run to his box and start digging from anywhere in the yard when you tell him to go dig. You can bury toys and bones in the box when he’s not looking so that he never knows what he’ll find in there. If you do see him starting to dig where he shouldn’t, say “Oops! Go dig!” to interrupt and invite him back to the box. If he doesn’t have lots of unsupervised time to reward himself for digging in the wrong places, he will eventually confine his digging to his box. An additional benefit to teaching him the Go Dig cue is that you can use it anytime you are in a place where digging is allowed—like the beach, where digging in the sand is great fun for dogs and humans alike. You can also make use of his talents when you need a hole dug—to plant a tree, put in fence posts, or perhaps bury a treasure.</p>
<h1 id="barking">Barking</h1>
<p>Simply slapping a no-bark electric shock collar (shudder) around the backyard dog’s neck may stop the barking, but it does nothing to help the dog become less bored, lonely, or frustrated. My answer to the dog owner who asks how to get a dog to stop barking in the backyard day and night is simply to bring him indoors. This relieves his loneliness because: • He is now more a part of the family • It does away with boredom because there are more interesting things going on inside the house</p>
<p>• It shuts out the stimuli that frustrate him—like squirrels in the trees and cats on the fence • It lifts the burden from his shoulders of feeling like he’s the only member of the pack who is guarding the den</p>
<p>we just want to be able to turn the barking off when we want. You can do this with a positive interrupt, or you can get more inventive and teach Woofie to bark on cue in order to teach him to stop barking on cue.</p>
<p>To use the positive interrupt, begin by teaching Woofie that over here means “Turn toward me for a click! and a treat.” Practice this on-leash with a small distraction, like sniffing a bush, until Woofie looks to you eagerly when he hears the Over Here cue.</p>
<p>“Over Here!” As soon as he stops barking and turns toward you for his treat, click! and tell him “Quiet. Good boy!” then click! again for the quiet and give him another treat. (I actually have my clients say “Thank you!” to their dogs when we do this, to remind them that we really do appreciate having our dogs alert us to unusual visitors and events.)</p>
<p>whatever it is that gets Woofie to bark—walking up the sidewalk, knocking on the door, opening the door, or whatever. The more you repeat it, the less excited</p>
<p>Woofie will be about the knock on the door and the quicker he will be to turn toward you on the Over Here cue. Of course, the next time someone comes to the door, Woofie will be excited all over again—it takes time and numerous repetitions of this exercise to get Woofie to give up his deeply ingrained, out-of-control barking behavior. Remember that you are not using the Quiet cue to make your dog stop barking—you are waiting until he stops barking and then telling him that the behavior of not barking is called quiet. In time, when Woofie has learned to associate the word with the behavior of being quiet, you will be able to get him to stop barking with the Quiet cue, but if you use it in the beginning while he’s barking, you will be teaching him that quiet actually means “bark.” In fact, I honestly believe that a lot of dogs think their owners are barking with them when they are actually yelling at them to shut up! I avoid teaching dogs to bark on cue if they don’t already bark a lot, but for those who are problem barkers, it can be a superb solution to the barking behavior challenge. Getting the bark on cue is the easy part—barky dogs are usually more than willing to offer the behavior. You probably already know what stimulates Woofie to bark. If it’s a knock on the door, then knock on the door, click! when he barks, and feed him a treat. If this works, do it again, but say “Speak!” or “Who’s there?” just before you knock. When he barks, click! and treat. Because he likes to bark anyway, in very short order he will probably bark for you on just the verbal cue, without the knock. Aside from using this exercise to teach Woofie to be quiet on cue, it can also be useful for self-protection. I had one client who taught her dog that What Do You Want? was the cue to start barking. She could then use it if she felt threatened by an approaching stranger, and her very friendly dog would bark nonstop and quite convincingly keep the potential bad guy at a distance. Now that you have the bark on cue, you can teach Quiet or Enough by clicking and rewarding a pause in the barking. Again, remember that in the beginning you won’t be asking Woofie to stop barking with the verbal cue; you’ll just be associating the quiet word with the cessation of barking. Eventually, when you know he has made the connection between the word and the behavior, you will be able to use the cue to ask him to stop barking. Remember first to thank him for alerting you to something going on in the world. You never know when he might be trying to tell you that there’s a burglar outside, that Timmy has fallen into the well, or that your horses are running down your driveway.</p>
<h1 id="separation-anxiety">Separation Anxiety</h1>
<p>Separation anxiety (SA), the canine equivalent of a panic disorder,</p>
<p>A less intense stress response in dogs over being left alone is called isolation distress (ID).</p>
<p>Spend fifteen to twenty minutes in a hard play session every morning to take the edge off Shep’s energy level before you leave the house.</p>
<p>• Provide as much exercise as possible at other times of the day as well. A dog who has a reservoir of pent-up energy is more stressed than one who is tired. A tired dog is usually a happier and better-behaved dog.</p>
<p>• Be calm when you leave and return. Dramatic good-byes and hellos raise Shep’s anxiety level.</p>
<p>• Give Shep a Kong toy or marrow bone filled with peanut butter or cheese just before you leave.</p>
<p>• Do not crate Shep unless you know she stays calm in the crate while you are gone.</p>
<h1 id="biting">Biting</h1>
<p>all dogs can bite. And under the right set of circumstances, the gentlest, most loving dog can be induced to bite.</p>
<p>high. Aggression is caused by stress. Each thing (stimulus) that causes a dog stress is a small building block (stressor) toward that dog’s bite threshold.</p>
<p>a dozen or more commonly recognized classifications of aggression, including status-related aggression, fear-related aggression, maternal aggression (a mom protecting her puppies), play aggression (when a dog’s level of arousal escalates during play and turns into aggression), displaced aggression, pain aggression, territorial aggression, possession aggression, protection aggression, barrier aggression, and redirected aggression.</p>
<h1 id="resource-guarding">Resource Guarding</h1>
<p>You can build on this foundation by working with Gimme at her mealtimes in a four-week resource-guarding program. Begin by setting her dish on the counter and putting her kibble in it. During week one, feed her the entire meal by hand, one kibble at a time. Have other family members take turns feeding her, and even allow an occasional visitor to do it so that she really gets the concept that humans deliver resources. Be sure to include children in the mix—you want her to realize that having small humans around her food bowl is a good thing. In week two, set Gimme’s empty food bowl on the floor and put her meal in a second dish on the counter. Now drop a few kibbles into her dish, and while she is eating those, drop a few more. You want her to realize that when a human hand approaches her bowl it is not coming to take her food away; instead, more food is coming. Again, have all the family participate, and include an occasional friend in the mealtime ritual. During week three, put her bowl on the floor with about ¼ of her meal already in it. As she eats, continue to add more kibble, and occasionally add something really wonderful, like a slice of hot dog, chicken, or roast beef. Now you are teaching her that not only does the approaching hand bring more food, it actually brings better food. By now she should be pretty well convinced that having humans around her food bowl is a wonderful idea. In the final week of your food bowl training, continue to drop kibble into her bowl as she eats. Now, assuming that she is showing absolutely no signs of food guarding when you reach toward her bowl, pick the bowl up while at the same time you drop pieces of her really wonderful treat on the floor. The message you’re giving to Gimme is that food bowl going away = really wonderful food on the ground. While you have the food bowl in your hand, put a few more pieces of the really wonderful treat in it and set it back down on the ground after she has finished the treats you dropped. You are simply reinforcing the concept that having humans mess with her food bowl is good—it returns to her with even better stuff in it. If you, and others, for the rest of Gimme’s life, continue to occasionally drop great stuff in her bowl while she is eating, she will always recognize humans near her bowl as a good thing and should never develop a food-guarding problem.</p>
<p>Dogs do what feels good, or, as behaviorists say, behavior is reward driven. If your dog is doing something that you want to change, at some level it is rewarding to her. Find out what the reward is and you are well on your way to changing the behavior.</p>
<p>Your attention is a huge reinforcer. Even negative attention (like yelling) is reinforcing—in your dog’s mind, something is better than nothing.</p>
<h1 id="babies-and-kids">Babies and Kids</h1>
<p>make good things happen whenever babies were around.</p>
<p>Don’t be stingy here—leave Lady’s dinner kibble at home. Instead, get out the hot dogs, cheese, steak, chicken—whatever Lady likes best—and keep feeding her one tiny piece at a time. You don’t even need to click! her for this; you’re not trying to change or teach a behavior; you’re trying to influence the way that her brain responds to the presence of children. (This is called classical conditioning, like Pavlov’s salivating dogs.) We just want Lady to realize that the presence of babies and small children is a reliable predictor of wonderful treats.</p>
<p>You can also have the babies’ parents or babysitters and some well-behaved small children feed treats to Lady and pet her gently so that she realizes that not only do good things happen when kids are around, some of the good things actually come from the children.</p>
<p>• Never leave dogs, babies, and/or small children (under age 10—or older if the dog is large and active) together unsupervised. No matter how trustworthy the dog, a responsible adult must always be actively observing the interaction between dog and baby human(s).</p>
<p>• Give the dog an escape route. When Junior starts moving, he can be pretty determined and irritating.</p>
<p>toddler fingers in her eyes, ears, and mouth. Teach Lady how to jump over a low barrier to reach safety if she has had enough baby for the moment. Dogs who can’t escape their tiny tormentors are more likely to bite in self-defense. • Teach your dog bite inhibition so that if she does feel compelled to bite in self-defense, she will give an inhibited warning bite rather than a serious bite. (See chapter 22, “A Biting Commentary.”) • Teach your children to respect the dog. Children should handle dogs gently and kindly. As soon as Junior is old enough to understand, he needs to learn that it is not okay to hit, poke, kick, or pull Lady’s ears or tail. He should also be taught that Lady’s crate is her sanctuary—she is never to be disturbed there. Until he is old enough to understand, it is the responsibility of the supervising adult to prevent Junior from tormenting Lady. • Teach your children basic dog safety tips: • Never approach an unfamiliar dog. • Never run away from a dog. • Never scream near a dog. • Stand still when an unfamiliar dog approaches. • Do not hug a dog unless an adult has told you that you can hug him.</p>
<p>• Do not stare into a dog’s eyes. • Do not disturb a dog who is sleeping, eating, resting in his crate, or with or near her puppies. • Do not play with a dog unless supervised by an adult.</p>

<li>
<p>Training your dog should be fun! A competent instructor will allow and encourage you to observe a class prior to making the decision to enroll. In a well-run class, dogs and people will be enjoying themselves and having a successful learning experience. Look for an instructor who is approachable and who encourages participants to have a good time. If space permits, an instructor should welcome and encourage all family members and others who interact with the dog to attend class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A skilled class instructor will Provide a clear explanation of each lesson. Demonstrate the behavior(s) that students will be teaching to their dogs. Provide clear instructions and written handouts on how to teach the behavior(s). Give students ample time in class to begin practicing the day’s lesson. Assist students individually with proper implementation of techniques. 3. A skilled and professional trainer will encourage dialogue and be courteous to both canine and human clients alike. 4. You want to be comfortable with the training tools and methods used by the instructor. A skilled and professional dog trainer employs humane training methods that are not harmful to the dog and/or handler and avoids the practices of hanging, beating, kicking, shocking, and all similar procedures or training devices that could cause the dog great pain or distress, or that have imminent potential for physical harm. You have the absolute right to stop any trainer or other animal-care professional who, in your opinion, is causing your dog undue harm or distress. 5. A conscientious trainer will stay informed about innovations in dog training and behavior tools and techniques. Check to see if the instructor is a member of any</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>educational organizations such as the APDT, and whether s/he pursues ongoing educational opportunities. 6. A good instructor will take care to protect your dog’s health in a group setting. Ask if dogs and puppies are required to be vaccinated prior to class and, if so, which vaccines are required. Make sure you and your veterinarian are comfortable with the vaccination requirements. 7. Current clients are a valuable source of information for you. Attending a group class gives you the opportunity to ask clients how they feel about their experience—if they are enjoying the class and feel that their training needs and goals are being met. 8. Because of variables in dog breeding and temperament and owner commitment and experience, a trainer cannot and should not guarantee the results of his/her training. However, an instructor can and should be willing to ensure client satisfaction with his/her professional services.</p>

<p>Heel: Walk by my left side with your shoulder even with my knee.</p>
<p>Jackpot: Exceptionally good effort—you are earning extra rewards!</p>
<p>Leave It: Whatever you are touching or paying attention to, leave it alone; get off someone or something; don’t touch.</p>
<p>Let’s Walk: Walk with me without pulling on the leash, or walk closely with me with no leash, but not necessarily in the heel position.</p>
<p>No: What you are doing is very bad or dangerous—stop immediately! (Use very sparingly, just for life-threatening situations, and when you do use it, say it like you mean it!)</p>
<p>Oops (or Wrong, Mistake, Sorry): The behavior you are doing will not earn you a reward. (This is referred to as a no-reward marker and is also used sparingly.)</p>
